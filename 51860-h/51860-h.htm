<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04">THIS little book has for its object to interest the
many winter visitors to the Ligurian coast in
the places that they see.</p>

<p>A consecutive history of Provence and Genoese
Liguria was out of the question; it would be long
and tedious. I have taken a few of the most prominent
incidents in the history of the coast, and have given
short biographies of interesting personages connected
with it. The English visitor calls the entire coast&mdash;from
Marseilles to Genoa&mdash;the Riviera; but the French
distinguish their portion as the Côte d’Azur, and the
Italians distinguish theirs as the Riviera di Ponente.
I have not included the whole of this latter, so as not
to make the book too bulky, but have stayed my pen
at Savona.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN a gambler has become bankrupt at the
tables of Monte Carlo, the Company that owns
these tables furnish him with a railway ticket that will
take him home, or to any distance he likes, the further
the better, that he may hang or shoot himself anywhere
else save in the gardens of the Casino. On much the same
principle, at the beginning of last century, the physicians
of England recommended their consumptive patients to
go to Montpellier, where they might die out of sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and not bring discredit on their doctors. As Murray
well puts it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is difficult to understand how it came to be chosen by
the physicians of the North as a retreat for consumptive
patients, since nothing can be more trying to weak lungs
than its variable climate, its blazing sunshine alternating with
the piercingly cold blasts of the <i>mistral</i>. Though its sky be
clear, its atmosphere is filled with dust, which must be hurtful
to the lungs.”</p>

<p class="p1">The discovery of a better place, with equable temperature,
and protection from the winds, was due to an
accident.</p>

<p>In 1831, Lord Brougham, flying from the fogs and
cold of England in winter, was on his way to Italy, the
classic land of sunshine, when he was delayed on the
French coast of the Mediterranean by the fussiness of
the Sardinian police, which would not suffer him to pass
the frontier without undergoing quarantine, lest he
should be the means of introducing cholera into Piedmont.
As he was obliged to remain for a considerable
time on the coast, he spent it in rambling along the Gulf
of Napoule. This was to him a veritable revelation.
He found the sunshine, the climate, the flowers he was
seeking at Naples where he then was, at Napoule. He
went no farther; he bought an estate at Cannes, and
there built for himself a winter residence. He talked
about his discovery. It was written about in the papers.
Eventually it was heard of by the physicians, and they
ceased to recommend their patients to go to Montpellier,
but rather to try Cannes. When Lord Brougham settled
there, it was but a fishing village; in thirty years it was
transformed; and from Cannes stretches a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rosary of winter resorts to Hyères on one side to
Alassio on the other; as white grains threaded on the
line from Marseilles to Genoa. As this chain of villas,
hotels, casinos, and shops has sprung up so recently,
the whole looks extremely modern, and devoid of historic
interest. That it is not so, I hope to show. This
modern fringe is but a fringe on an ancient garment;
but a superficial sprinkling over beds of remote antiquity
rich in story.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is but a glimpse we get&mdash;as at Antibes,
where a monument was dug up dedicated to the manes
of a little “boy from the North, aged twelve years, who
danced and pleased” in the theatre. The name of the
poor lad is not given; but what a picture does it present!
Possibly, of a British child-slave sent to caper, with
sore heart, before the Roman nobles and ladies&mdash;and
who pined and died. But often we have more than a
hint. The altar piece of the Burning Bush at Aix
gives up an authentic portrait of easy-going King
Réné, the luckless wearer of many crowns, and the
possessor of not a single kingdom&mdash;Réné, the father
of the still more luckless Margaret, wife of our
Henry VI.</p>

<p>Among the Montagnes des Maures, on a height are the
cisterns and foundations of the stronghold of the Saracens,
their last stronghold on this side of the Pyrenees,
whence they swept the country, burning and slaying, till
dislodged in 972 by William, Count of Provence. Again,
the house at Draguignan of Queen Joanna, recalls her
tragic story; the wife of four husbands, the murderess of
the first, she for whose delectation Boccaccio collected his
merry, immoral tales; she, who sold Avignon to the
Popes, and so brought about their migration from Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the Babylonish captivity of near a hundred years; she&mdash;strangled
finally whilst at her prayers.</p>

<p>The Estérel, now clothed in forest, reminds us of how
Charles V. advancing through Provence to claim it as
his own, hampered by peasants in this group of mountains,
set the forests on fire, and for weeks converted the
district into one great sea of flame around the blood-red
rocks.</p>

<p>Marseilles recalls the horrors of the Revolution, and
the roar of that song, smelling of blood, to which it gave
its name. At Toulon, Napoleon first drew attention to
his military abilities; at S. Raphael he landed on his
return from Egypt, on his way to Paris, to the 18th
Brumaire, to the Consulate, to the Empire; and here
also he embarked for Elba after the battle of Leipzig.</p>

<p>But leaving history, let us look at what Nature affords
of interest. Geologically that coast is a great picture
book of successions of deposits and of convulsions.
There are to be found recent conglomerates, chalk,
limestone, porphyry, new red sandstone, mica schist,
granite. The Estérel porphyry is red as if on fire, seen
in the evening sun. The mica schist of the Montagnes
des Maures strews about its dust, so shining, so golden,
that in 1792 a representative of the Department went
up to Paris with a handful, to exhibit to the Convention
as a token of the ineptitude of the Administration of
Var, that trampled under foot treasures sufficient to
defray the cost of a war against all the kings of the
earth.</p>

<p>The masses of limestone are cleft with <i>clus</i>, gorges
through which the rivers thunder, and <i>foux</i> springs of
living water bursting out of the bowels of the mountains.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider what the variety of geologic formation implies:
an almost infinite variety of plants; moreover,
owing to the difference of altitudes, the flora reaches in
a chromatic scale from the fringe of the Alpine snows to
the burning sands by the seas. In one little commune,
it is estimated that there are more varieties to be found
than in the whole of Ireland.</p>

<p>But the visitor to the seaboard&mdash;the French Côte
d’azur and the Italian Riviera&mdash;returns home after a winter
sojourn there with his mind stored with pictures of
palms, lemons, oranges, agaves, aloes, umbrella pines,
eucalyptus, mimosa, carob-trees, and olives. This is the
vegetation that characterises the Riviera, that distinguishes
it from vegetation elsewhere; but, although
these trees and shrubs abound, and do form a dominant
feature in the scenery, yet every one of them is a foreign
importation, and the indigenous plants must be sought
in mountain districts, away from towns, and high-roads,
and railways.</p>

<p>These strangers from Africa, Asia, Australia and
South America have occupied the best land and the
warmest corners, just as of old the Greek and Roman
colonists shouldered out the native tribes, and forced
them to withdraw amidst the mountains.</p>

<p>The traveller approaching the Riviera by the line
from Lyons, after passing Valence, enters a valley that
narrows, through which rolls the turbid flood of the
Rhone. Presently the sides become steeper, higher,
more rocky, and draw closer; on the right appears
Viviers, dominated by its cathedral and tower, square
below, octagonal above, and here the Rhone becomes
more rapid as it enters the <i>Robinet de Donzère</i>, between
calcareous rocks full of caves and rifts. Then, all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
once, the line passes out of the rocky portal, and the
traveller enters on another scene altogether, the vast
triangular plain limited by the Alps on one side and the
Cevennes on the other, and has the Mediterranean as
its base. To this point at one time extended a mighty
gulf, seventy miles from the present coast-line at the
mouth of the Rhone. Against the friable limestone
cliffs, the waves lapped and leaped. But at some unknown
time a cataclysm occurred. The Alps were
shaken, as we shake a tree to bring down its fruit, and
the Rhone and the Durance, swollen to an enormous
volume, rolled down masses of débris into this gulf and
choked it. The Durance formed its own little <i>crau</i>
along the north of the chain of the Alpines, and the Rhone
the far larger <i>crau</i> of Arles, the pebbles of which all
come from the Alps, in which the river takes it rise. But,
in fact, the present <i>craus</i> represent but a small portion of
the vast mass of rubbish brought down. They are just
that part which in historic times was not overlaid with
soil.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>When this period was passed, the rivers relaxed their
force, and repented of the waste they had made, and
proceeded to chew into mud the pebbles they rolled
along, and, rambling over the level stretches of rubble, to
deposit upon it a fertilising epidermis. Then, in modern
times, the engineers came and banked in the Rhone, to
restrain its vagaries, so that now it pours its precious
mud into the sea, and yearly projects its ugly muzzle
further forwards. When we passed the rocky portal, we
passed also from the climate of the North into that of
the South, but not to that climate without hesitations.
For the sun beating on the level land heats the pebble
bed, so that the air above it quivers as over a lime-kiln,
and, rising, is replaced by a rush of icy winds from the
Alps. This downrush is the dreaded Mistral. It was a
saying of old:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Parlement, Mistral, et Durance<br />
Sont les trois fléaux de Provence.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The Parliament is gone, but the Mistral still rages, and
the Durance still overflows and devastates.</p>

<p>The plain, where cultivated, is lined and cross-lined as
with Indian ink. These lines, and cross-lines, are formed
of cypress, veritable walls of defence, thrown up against
the wind. When the Mistral rages, they bow as whips,
and the water of the lagoons is licked up and spat at the
walls of the sparsely scattered villages. Here and there
rises the olive, like smoke from a lowly cottage. It
shrinks from the bite of the frost and the lash of the
wind, and attains its proper height and vigour only as
we near the sea; and is in the utmost luxuriance
between Solliès Pont and Le Luc, growing on the rich
new red sandstone, that skirts the Montagnes des
Maures.</p>

<p>Presently we come on the lemon, the orange, glowing
golden, oleanders in every gully, aloes (“God’s candelabra”),
figs, mulberries, pines with outspread heads, like
extended umbrellas, as the cypress represents one folded;
cork trees, palms with tufted heads; all seen through an
atmosphere of marvellous clearness, over-arched by a sky
as blue as that of Italy, and with&mdash;as horizon&mdash;the
deeper, the indigo blue, of the sea.</p>

<p>On leaving Arles, the train takes the bit between its
teeth and races over the <i>crau</i>, straight as an arrow,
between lines of cypresses. It is just possible to catch
glimpses to the north, between the cypresses, of a chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of hills of opalescent hue. That chain, Les Alpines,
gives its direction to the Durance. This river lent its
aid to Brother Rhone to form this rubble plain, the
<i>Campus lapideus</i> of the Romans, the modern <i>crau</i>. This
was a desert over which the mirage alternated with the
Mistral, till Adam de Craponne, in the sixteenth century,
brought a canal from the Durance to water the stony
land, and since then, little by little, the desert is being
reclaimed. This vast stony plain was a puzzle to the
ancients, and Æschylus, who flourished <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 472, tells us
that Heracles, arriving at this plain to fight the Ligurians,
and being without weapons, Heaven came to his aid and
poured down great stones out of the sky against his foes.
This is much like the account in Joshua of the battle
against the Kings in the plain of Esdraelon.</p>

<p>At length, at Miramas, we escape from between the
espalier cypresses and see that the distant chain has
drawn nearer, that it has lost its mother-of-pearl tints,
and has assumed a ghastly whiteness. Then we dash
among these cretaceous rocks, desolate, forbidding and
dead. They will attend us from Marseilles to Toulon.</p>

<p>The cretaceous sea bed, that once occupied so vast an
area, has been lifted into downs and mountains, and
stretched from Dorset and Wiltshire to Dover. We
catch a glimpse of it at Amiens. A nodule that has
defied erosion sustains the town and cathedral of Laon.
It underlies the Champagne country. It asserts itself
sullenly and resolutely in Provence, where it overlies
the Jura limestone, and is almost indistinguishable from
it at the junction, for it has the same inclination, the
same fossils, and the same mineralogical constituents.</p>

<p>In England we are accustomed to the soft skin of
thymy turf that covers the chalk on our downs. Of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
there is none in Provence. The fierce sun forbids it.
Consequently the rock is naked and cadaverously white,
but scantily sprinkled over with stunted pines.</p>

<p>The Jura limestone is the great <i>pièce de resistance</i> in
Provence: it is sweeter in colour than the chalk, ranging
from cream white to buff and salmon; it has not the
dead pallor of the chalk. Any one who has gone down
the Cañon of the Tarn knows what exquisite gradations
and harmonies of tone are to be found in Jura limestone.
Here this formation stands up as a wall to the
North, a mighty screen, sheltering the Riviera from the
boreal winds. It rises precipitously to a plateau that is
bald and desolate, but which is rent by ravines of great
majesty and beauty, through which rush the waters from
the snowy Alps. The chalk and the limestone are
fissured, and allow the water flowing over their surface
to filter down and issue forth in the valleys, rendering
these fertile and green, whereas the plateaux are
bare. The plateaux rise to the height of 3,000 or 4,500
feet.</p>

<p>The tract between the mountain wall of limestone
and the sea is made up of a molass of rolled fragments
of the rock in a paste of mud. This forms hills of
considerable height, and this also is sawn through here
and there by rills, or washed out by rivers.</p>

<p>Altogether different in character is the mass of the
Montagnes des Maures, which is an uplifted body of
granite and schist.</p>

<p>Altogether different again is the Estérel, a protruded
region of red porphyry.</p>

<p>About these protruded masses may be seen the new
red sandstone.</p>

<p>When we have mastered this&mdash;and it is simple enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to remember&mdash;we know the character of the geology
from the mouths of the Rhone to Albenga.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The colouring of Provence,” says Mr. Hammerton, “is
pretty in spring, when the fields are still green and the mulberry
trees are in leaf, and the dark cypress and grey olive are
only graver notes in the brightness, while the desolation of the
stony hills is prevented from becoming oppressive by the
freshness of the foreground; but when the hot sun and the dry
wind have scorched every remnant of verdure, when any grass
that remains is merely ungathered hay, and you have nothing
but flying dust and blinding light, then the great truth is borne
in upon you that it is Rain which is the true colour magician,
though he may veil himself in a vesture of grey cloud.”</p>

<p class="p1">In winter and early spring it is that the coast is enjoyable.
In winter there is the evergreen of the palms, the
olive, the ilex, the cork tree, the carob, the orange and
lemon and myrtle. Indeed, in the Montagnes des
Maures and in the Estérel, it is always spring.</p>

<p>The resident in winter can hardly understand the
structure of the towns, with streets at widest nine feet,
and the houses running up to five and six storeys; but
this is due to necessity. The object is double: by making
the streets so narrow, the sun is excluded, and the sun
in Provence is not sought as with us in England; and
secondly, these narrow thoroughfares induce a draught
down them. In almost every town the contrast between
the new and the old is most marked, for the occupants
of the new town reside there for the winter only, and
therefore court the sun; whereas the inhabitants of the
old town dwell in it all the year round, and consequently
endeavour to obtain all protection possible from the
sun. But this shyness of basking in the sun was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the sole reason why the streets were made so narrow.
The old towns and even villages were crowded within
walls; a girdle of bulwark surrounded them, they had no
space for expansion except upwards.</p>

<p>What Mr. Hammerton says of French towns applies
especially to those of Provence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“France has an immense advantage over England in the
better harmony between her cities and towns, and the country
where they are placed. In England it rarely happens that
a town adds to the beauty of a landscape; in France it often
does so. In England there are many towns that are quite
absolutely and hideously destructive of landscape beauty; in
France there are very few. The consequence is that in France
a lover of landscape does not feel that dislike to human interference
which he so easily acquires in England, and which in
some of our best writers, who feel most intensely and acutely,
has become positive hatred and exasperation.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was fear of the Moors and the pirates of the
Mediterranean which drove the inhabitants of the sea-coast
to build their towns on the rocks, high uplifted,
walled about and dominated by towers.</p>

<p>I will now give a hasty sketch of the early history of
Provence&mdash;so far as goes to explain the nature of its
population.</p>

<p>The earliest occupants of the seaboard named in
history are the Ligurians. The Gulf of Lyons takes its
name from them, in a contracted form. Who these
Ligurians were, to what stock they belonged, is not
known; but as there are megalithic monuments in the
country, covered avenues at Castelet, near Arles,
dolmens at Draguignan and Saint Vallier, a menhir at
Cabasse, we may perhaps conclude with some probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that they were a branch of that great Ivernian race
which has covered all Western Europe with these
mysterious remains. At an early period, the Phœnicians
established trading depôts at Marseilles, Nice, and elsewhere
along the coast. Monaco was dedicated to their
god, Melkarth, whose equivalent was the Greek Heracles,
the Roman Hercules. The story of Heracles fighting
the gigantic Ligurians on the <i>crau</i>, assisted by Zeus
pouring down a hail of pebbles from heaven, is merely
a fabulous rendering of the historic fact that the Phœnician
settlers had to fight the Ligurians, represented as
giants, not because they were of monstrous size, but because
of their huge stone monuments.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians drew a belt of colonies and trading
stations along the Mediterranean, and were masters of
the commerce. The tin of Britain, the amber of the
Baltic, passed through their hands, and their great
emporium was Marseilles. It was they who constructed
the Heraclean Road, afterwards restored and regulated
by the Romans, that connected all their settlements
from the Italian frontier to the Straits of Gibraltar.
They have left traces of their sojourn in place names;
in their time, Saint Gilles, then Heraclea, was a port at
the mouth of the Rhone; now it is thirty miles inland.
Herculea Caccabaria, now Saint Tropez, recalls Kaccabe,
the earliest name of Carthage. One of the islets outside
the harbour of Marseilles bore the name of
Phœnice.</p>

<p>This energetic people conveyed the ivory of Africa to
Europe, worked the lead mines of the Eastern Pyrenees,
and sent the coral and purple of the Mediterranean
and the bronze of the Po basin over Northern Europe.
The prosperity of Tyre depended on its trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Inventors of alphabetical writing, of calculation, and of
astronomy, essential to them in their distant navigations, skilful
architects, gold-workers, jewellers, engravers, weavers,
dyers, miners, founders, glass-workers, coiners, past-masters of
all industries, wonderful sailors, intrepid tradesmen, the
Phœnicians, by their incomparable activity, held the old
world in their grip; and from the Persian Gulf to the Isles of
Britain, either by their caravans or by their ships, were everywhere
present as buyers or sellers.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Archæological discoveries come to substantiate the
conclusions arrived at from scanty allusions by the
ancients. The Carthaginians had succeeded to the trade
of Tyre; but Carthage was a daughter of Tyre. At
Marseilles have been found forty-seven little stone
chapels or shrines of Melkarth, seated under an arch,
either with his hands raised, sustaining the arch, or with
them resting on his knees; and these are identical in
character with others found at Tyre, Sidon, and Carthage.
Nor is this all. An inscription has been unearthed,
also at Marseilles, containing a veritable Levitical code
for the worship of Baal, regulating the emoluments of
his priests.</p>

<p>In the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 542 a fleet of Phocœans came from
Asia Minor, flying from the Medes; and the citizens of
Phocœa, abandoning their ancient homes, settled along
the coast of the Riviera. Arles, Marseilles, Nice&mdash;all the
towns became Greek. It was they who introduced into
the land of their adoption the vine and the olive. They
acquired the trade of the Mediterranean after the fall of
Carthage, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 146.</p>

<p>The Greeks of the coast kept on good terms with
Rome. They it was who warned Rome of the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of Hannibal; and when the Ambrons and Teutons
poured down a mighty host with purpose to devastate
Italy, the Phocœan city of Marseilles furnished Marius
with a contingent, and provisioned his camp at the
junction of the Durance with the Rhone.</p>

<p>The Romans were desirous of maintaining good relations
with the Greek colonies, and when the native
Ligurians menaced Nice and Antibes, they sent an
army to their aid, and having defeated the barbarians,
gave up the conquered territory to the Greeks.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 125, Lucius Sextius Calvinus attacked the
native tribes in their fastness, defeated them, and
founded the town of Aquæ Sextiæ, about the hot
springs that rise there&mdash;now Aix. The Ligurians were
driven to the mountains and not suffered to approach
the sea coast, which was handed over entirely to the
Greeks of Marseilles.</p>

<p>So highly stood the credit of Marseilles, that when,
after the conclusion of the Asiatic War, the Senate of
Rome had decreed the destruction of Phocœa, they
listened to a deputation from Marseilles, pleading for the
mother city, and revoked the sentence. Meanwhile, the
Gauls had been pressing south, and the unfortunate
Ligurians, limited to the stony plateaux and the slopes of
the Alps, were nipped between them and the Greeks and
Romans along the coast. They made terms with the
Gauls and formed a Celto-Ligurian league. They were
defeated, and the Senate of Rome decreed the annexation
of all the territory from the Rhone to the Alps, to
constitute thereof a province. Thenceforth the cities
and slopes of the coast became places of residence for
wealthy Romans, who had there villas and gardens. The
towns were supplied with amphitheatres and baths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Theatres they possessed before, under the Greeks; but
the brutal pleasures of the slaughter of men was an
introduction by the Romans. The remains of these
structures at Nîmes, Arles, Fréjus, Cimiez, testify to the
crowds that must have delighted in these horrible
spectacles. That of Nîmes would contain from 17,000
to 23,000 spectators; that of Arles 25,000; that of
Fréjus an equal number.</p>

<p>Wherever the Roman empire extended, there may be
seen the same huge structures, almost invariable in plan,
and all devoted to pleasure and luxury. The forum,
the temples, sink into insignificance beside the amphitheatre,
the baths, and the circus. Citizens of the empire
lived for their ease and amusements, and concerned
themselves little about public business. In the old days
of the Republic, the interests, the contests, of the people
were forensic. The forum was their place of assembly.
But with the empire all was changed. Public transaction
of business ceased, the despotic Cæsar provided for,
directed, governed all, Roman citizens and subject
peoples alike. They were left with nothing to occupy
them, and they rushed to orgies of blood. Thus these
vast erections tell us, more than the words of any historian,
how great was the depravity of the Roman character.</p>

<p>But with the fifth century this condition of affairs
came to an end. The last time that the circus of Arles
was used for races was in 462. The theatre there was
wrecked by a deacon called Cyril in 446. At the head
of a mob he burst into it, and smashed the loveliest
statues of the Greek chisel, and mutilated every article
of decoration therein. The stage was garnished with
elegant colonnets; all were thrown down and broken,
except a few that were carried off to decorate churches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
All the marble casing was ripped away, the bas-reliefs
were broken up, and the fragments heaped in the pit.
There was some excuse for this iconoclasm. The stage
had become licentious to the last degree, and there was
no drawing the people from the spectacles. “If,” says
Salvian, “as often happens, the public games coincide
with a festival of the Church, where will the crowd be?
In the house of God, or in the amphitheatre?”</p>

<p>During that fifth century the Visigoths and the Burgundians
threatened Provence. When these entered
Gaul they were the most humanised of the barbarians;
they had acquired some aptitude for order, some love
of the discipline of civil life. They did not devastate
the cities, they suffered them to retain their old laws,
their religion, and their customs. With the sixth century
the domination of the Visigoths was transferred beyond
the Pyrenees, and the Burgundians had ceased to be an
independent nation; the Franks remained masters over
almost the whole of Gaul.</p>

<p>In 711 the Saracens, or Moors, crossed over at Gibraltar
and invaded Spain. They possessed themselves as well
of Sicily, Sardinia, and the Balearic Isles. Not content
with this, they cast covetous eyes on Gaul. They poured
through the defiles of the Pyrenees and spread over the
rich plains of Aquitaine and of Narbonne. Into this
latter city the Calif Omar II. broke in 720, massacred
every male, and reduced the women to slavery. Béziers,
Saint Gilles, Arles, were devastated; Nîmes opened to
them her gates. The horde mounted the valley of the
Rhone and penetrated to the heart of France. Autun
was taken and burnt in 725. All Provence to the Alps
was theirs. Then in 732 came the most terrible of their
invasions. More than 500,000 men, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
chroniclers, led by Abdel-Raman, crossed the Pyrenees,
took the road to Bordeaux, which they destroyed, and
ascended the coast till they were met and annihilated
by Charles Martel on the field of Poitiers.</p>

<p>From this moment the struggle changed its character.
The Christians assumed the offensive. Charles Martel
pursued the retreating host, and took from them the
port of Maguelonne; and when a crowd of refugees
sought shelter in the amphitheatre of Arles, he set fire to
it and hurled them back into the flames as they attempted
to escape. Their last stronghold was Narbonne, where
they held out for seven years, and then in 759 that also
fell, and the Moorish power for evil in France was at an
end; but all the south, from the Alps to the ocean, was
strewn with ruins.</p>

<p>They were not, however, wholly discouraged. Not
again, indeed, did they venture across the Pyrenees in
a great host; but they harassed the towns on the coast,
and intercepted the trade. When the empire of Charlemagne
was dismembered, Provence was separated from
France and constituted a kingdom, under the administration
of one Boso, who was crowned at Arles in 879.
This was the point of departure of successive changes,
which shall be touched on in the sequel. The German
kings and emperors laid claim to Provence as a vassal
state, and it was not till 1481 that it was annexed to the
Crown of France. Avignon and the Venaissin were not
united to France till 1791.</p>

<p>In no part of Europe probably did pagan customs
linger on with such persistence as in this favoured land
of Provence, among a people of mixed blood&mdash;Ligurian,
Phœnician, Greek, Roman, Saracen. Each current of
uniting blood brought with it some superstition, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
vicious propensity, or some strain of fancy. In the
very first mention we have of the Greek settlers, allusion
is made to the Floral Games. The Battle of Flowers,
that draws so many visitors to Nice, Mentone, and
Cannes, is a direct descendant from them; but it has
acquired a decent character comparatively recently.</p>

<p>At Arles, the Feast of Pentecost was celebrated
throughout the Middle Ages by games ending with races
of girls, stark naked, and the city magistrates presided
over them, and distributed the prizes, which were defrayed
out of the town chest. It was not till the sixteenth
century, owing to the remonstrances of a Capuchin friar,
that the exhibition was discontinued. Precisely the
same took place at Beaucaire. At Grasse, every Thursday
in Lent saw the performance in the public <i>place</i> of
dances and obscene games, and these were not abolished
till 1706 by the energy of the bishop, who threatened to
excommunicate every person convicted of taking part in
the disgusting exhibition of “Les Jouvines.”</p>

<p>A native of Tours visited Provence in the seventeenth
century, and was so scandalised at what he saw there,
that he wrote, in 1645, a letter of remonstrance to his
friend Gassendi. Here is what he says of the manner
in which the festival of S. Lazarus was celebrated at
Marseilles:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The town celebrates this feast by dances that have the
appearance of theatrical representations, through the multitude
and variety of the figures performed. All the inhabitants
assemble, men and women alike, wear grotesque masks, and
go through extravagant capers. One would think they were
satyrs fooling with nymphs. They hold hands, and race
through the town, preceded by flutes and violins. They form
an unbroken chain, which winds and wriggles in and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
among the streets, and this they call <i>le Grand Branle</i>. But
why this should be done in honour of S. Lazarus is a mystery
to me, as indeed are a host of other extravagances of which
Provence is full, and to which the people are so attached, that
if any one refuses to take part in them, they will devastate his
crops and his belongings.”</p>

<p class="p1">The carnival and micarême have taken the place of
this exhibition; and no one who has seen the revelries
at these by night can say that this sort of fooling is
nearing its end. Now these exhibitions have become a
source of profit to the towns, as drawing foreigners to
them, and enormous sums are lavished by the municipalities
upon them annually. The people of the place
enter into them with as much zest as in the centuries
that have gone by.</p>

<p>Dancing in churches and churchyards lasted throughout
the Middle Ages. The clergy in vain attempted to
put it down, and, unable to effect this, preceded these
choric performances by a sermon, to deter the people
from falling into excesses of extravagance and vice. At
Limoges, not indeed in Provence, the congregation was
wont to intervene in the celebration of the feast of their
apostle, S. Martial, by breaking out into song in the
psalms, “Saint Martial pray for us, and we will dance
for you!” Whereupon they joined hands and spun
round in the church.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This leads to the mention of what is of no small
interest in the history of the origin of part-singing.
Anyone familiar with vespers, as performed in French
churches, is aware that psalms and canticles are sung in
one or other fashion: either alternate verses alone are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
chanted, and the gap is filled in by the organ going
through astounding musical frolics; or else one verse is
chanted in plain-song, and the next in <i>fauxbourdon</i>&mdash;that
is to say, the tenor holds on to the plain-song,
whilst treble and alto gambol at a higher strain a melody
different, but harmonious with the plain-song. In
Provence at high mass the Gloria and Credo are divided
into paragraphs, and in like manner are sung alternately
in plain-song and <i>fauxbourdon</i>. The origin of this part-singing
is very curious. The congregation, loving to
hear their own voices, and not particularly interested in,
or knowing the Latin words, broke out into folk-song
at intervals, in the same “mode” as that of the tone
sung by the clergy. They chirped out some love ballad
or dance tune, whilst the officiants in the choir droned
the Latin of the liturgy. Even so late as 1645, the
Provençals at Christmas were wont to sing in the
<i>Magnificat</i> a vulgar song&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">
“Que ne vous requinquez-vous, Vielle,<br />
Que ne vous requinquez, donc?”</p>

<p class="pn1">which may be rendered&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">
“Why do you trick yourself out, old woman?<br />
O why do you trick yourself so?”</p>

<p class="p1">In order to stop this sort of thing the clergy had
recourse to “farcing” the canticles, <i>i.e.</i> translating
each verse into the vernacular, and interlarding the
Latin with the translation, in hopes that the people, if
sing they would, would adopt these words; but the
farced canticles were not to the popular taste, and they
continued to roar out lustily their folk-songs, often indelicate,
always unsuitable. This came to such a pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that either the organ was introduced to bellow the
people down, or else the system was accepted and regulated;
and to this is due the <i>fauxbourdon</i>. But in Italy
and in the South of France it passed for a while beyond
regulation. The musicians accepted it, and actually
composed masses, in which the tenor alone sang the
sacred words and the other parts performed folk-songs.</p>

<p class="p2">As Mr. Addington Symonds says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The singers were allowed innumerable licences. Whilst
the tenor sustained the Gregorian melody, the other voices
indulged in extempore descant, regardless of the style of the
main composition, violating time, and setting even the fundamental
tone at defiance. The composers, to advance another
step in the analysis of this strange medley, took particular
delight in combining different sets of words, melodies of
widely diverse character, antagonistic rhythms, and divergent
systems of accentuation, in a single piece. They assigned
these several ingredients to several parts, and for the further
exhibition of their perverse skill, went even to the length of
coupling themes in the major and the minor. The most
obvious result of such practice was that it became impossible
to understand what was being sung, and that instead of
concord and order in the choir, a confused discord and
anarchy of dinning sounds prevailed. What made the matter,
from an ecclesiastical point of view, still worse, was that these
scholastically artificial compositions were frequently based on
trivial and vulgar tunes, suggesting the tavern, the dancing-room,
or even worse places, to worshippers assembled for the
celebration of a Sacrament. Masses bore titles adopted from
the popular airs on which they were founded; such, for example,
as <i>Adieu, mes amours</i>, <i>À l’ombre d’un buissonnet</i>, <i>Baise moi</i>,
<i>Le vilain jaloux</i>. Even the words of love ditties and obscene
ballads were being squalled out by the tenor (treble?) while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the bass (tenor?) gave utterance to an <i>Agnus Dei</i> or a
<i>Benedictus</i>, and the soprano (alto?) was engaged upon the verses
of a Latin hymn. Baini, who examined hundreds of the masses
and motetts in MS., says that the words imported into them
from vulgar sources ‘make one’s flesh creep, and one’s hair
stand on end.’ He does not venture to do more than indicate
a few of the more decent of these interloping verses. As an
augmentation of this indecency, numbers from a mass which
started with the grave rhythm of a Gregorian tone were brought
to their conclusion on the dance measure of a popular <i>ballata</i>,
so that <i>Incarnatus est</i> or <i>Kyrie eleison</i> went jigging off into
suggestions of Masetto and Zerlina at a village ball.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The musicians who composed these masses simply
accepted what was customary, and all they did was to
endeavour to reduce the hideous discords to harmony.
But it was this superposing of folk-songs on Gregorian
tones that gave the start to polyphonic singing. The
state of confusion into which ecclesiastical music had
fallen by this means rendered it necessary that a reformation
should be undertaken, and the Council of Trent
(Sept. 17, 1562) enjoined on the Ordinaries to “exclude
from churches all such music as, whether through the
organ or the singing, introduces anything impure or
lascivious, in order that the house of God may truly be
seen to answer to its name, A House of Prayer.”
Indeed, all concerted and part music was like to have
been wholly banished from the service of the church,
had not Palestrina saved it by the composition of the
“Mass of Pope Marcellus.”</p>

<p>A visitor to Provence will look almost in vain for
churches in the Gothic style. A good many were built
after Lombard models. There remained too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
relics of Roman structures for the Provençals to take
kindly to the pointed arch. The sun had not to be
invited to pour into the naves, but was excluded as
much as might be, consequently the richly traceried
windows of northern France find no place here. The
only purely Gothic church of any size is that of
S. Maximin in Var. That having been a conventual
church, imported its architects from the north.</p>

<p>One curious and indeed unique feature is found in
the Provençal cathedral churches: the choir for the
bishop and chapter is at the west end, in the gallery,
over the narthex or porch. This was so at Grasse; it
remains intact at Vence.</p>

<span class="mid">LE GAI SABER</span></h2>

<p class="pch">The formation of the Provençal tongue&mdash;Vernacular ballads and songs:
brought into church&mdash;Recitative and formal music&mdash;Rhythmic music

<p class="drop-cap04">WHAT the language of the Ligurians was we do
not know. Among them came the Phœnicians,
then the Greeks, next the Romans. The Roman
soldiery and slaves and commercials did not talk the
stilted Latin of Cicero, but a simple vernacular. Next
came the Visigoths and the Saracens. What a jumble
of peoples and tongues! And out of these tongues
fused together the Langue d’oc was evolved.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how readily some subjugated peoples
acquire the language of their conquerors. The Gauls
came to speak Latin. The Welsh&mdash;the bulk of the
population was not British at all; dark-haired and dark-eyed,
they were conquered by the Cymri and adopted
their tongue. So in Provence, although there is a strong
strain of Ligurian blood, the Ligurian tongue is gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
past recall. The prevailing language is Romance; that
is to say, the vernacular Latin. <i>Verna</i> means a slave;
it was the gabble of the lower classes, mainly a bastard
Latin, but holding in suspense drift words from Greek
and Gaulish and Saracen. In substance it was the
vulgar talk of the Latins. Of this we have curious
evidence in 813. In his old age Charlemagne concerned
himself much with Church matters, and he convoked
five Councils in five quarters of his empire to regulate
Church matters. These Councils met in Mainz, Rheims,
Châlons, Tours, and Arles. It was expressly laid down
in all of these, save only in that of Arles, that the clergy
should catechise and preach in the vulgar tongue; where
there were Franks, in German; where there were Gauls,
in the Romance. But no such rule was laid down in
the Council of Arles, for the very reason that Latin was
still the common language of the people, the simple
Latin of the gospels, such as was perfectly understood
by the people when addressed in it.</p>

<p>The liturgy was not fixed and uniform. In many
secondary points each Church had its own use. Where
most liberty and variety existed was in the hymns. The
singing of hymns was not formally introduced into the
offices of the Church till the tenth century; but every
church had its collection of hymns, sung by the people
at vigils, in processions, intercalated in the offices. In
Normandy it was a matter of complaint that whilst the
choir took breath the women broke in with unsuitable
songs, <i>nugacis cantalenis</i>. At funerals such coarse ballads
were sung that Charlemagne had to issue orders that
where the mourners did not know any psalm they were
to shout <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, and nothing else. Agobard, Bishop
of Lyons, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 814-840, says that when he entered on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his functions he found in use in the church an antiphonary
compiled by the choir bishop, Amalric, consisting
of songs so secular, and many of them so indecent,
that, to use the expression of the pious bishop, they
could not be read without mantling the brow with
shame.</p>

<p>One of these early antiphonaries exists, a MS. of the
eleventh century belonging to the church of S. Martial.
Among many wholly unobjectionable hymns occurs a
ballad of the tale of Judith; another is frankly an
invocation to the nightingale, a springtide song; a third
is a dialogue between a lover and his lass.</p>

<p>It is in the ecclesiastical hymns, religious lessons, and
legends couched in the form of ballads, coming into use
in the eighth and ninth centuries, that we have the germs,
the rudiments, of a new literature; not only so, but also
the introduction of formal music gradually displacing
music that is recitative.</p>

<p>Of melodies there are two kinds, the first used as
a handmaid to poetry; in it there is nothing formal.
A musical phrase may be repeated or may not, as
required to give force to the words employed. This
was the music of the Greek and Roman theatre. The
lyrics of Horace and Tibullus could be sung to no
other. This, and this alone, was the music adopted by
the Church, and which we have still in the Nicene
Creed, Gloria, Sanctus, and Pater Noster. But this
never could have been the music of the people&mdash;it could
not be used by soldiers to march to, nor by the peasants
as dance tunes.</p>

<p>Did rhythmic music exist among the ancients side by
side with recitative? Almost certainly it did, utterly
despised by the cultured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>When Julius Cæsar was celebrating his triumph at
Rome after his Gaulish victories, we are informed that
the soldiery marched singing out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Gallias Cæsar subegit<br />
Mithridates Cæsarem.<br />
Ecce Cæsar nunc triumphat,<br />
Qui subegit Gallias,<br />
Nicomedes non triumphat,<br />
Qui subegit Cæsarem.”</p>

<p class="pn1">This must have been sung to a formal melody, to which
the soldiers tramped in time.</p>

<p>So also Cæsar, in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 49, like a liberal-minded man,
desired to admit the principal men of Cisalpine Gaul
into the Senate. This roused Roman prejudice and
mockery. Prejudice, because the Gauls were esteemed
barbarians; mockery, because of their peculiar costume&mdash;their
baggy trousers. So the Roman rabble composed
and sang verses, “<i>illa vulgo canebantur</i>.” These may be
rendered in the same metre:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Cæsar led the Gauls in triumph,</p>
<p class="pp7">Then to Senate-house admits.</p>
<p class="pp6">First must they pull off their trousers,</p>
<p class="pp7">Ere the laticlavus fits.”</p>

<p class="p1">Now, it may be noted that in both instances the
rhythm is not at all that of the scientifically constructed
metric lines of Horace, Tibullus, and Catullus, but is
neither more nor less than our familiar 8.7. time. The
first piece of six lines in 8.7. is precisely that of “Lo!
He comes in clouds descending.” The second of four
lines is that of the familiar Latin hymn, <i>Tantum ergo</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and is indeed that also of our hymn, “Hark! the sound
of holy voices.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Nor is this all. Under Cæsar’s statue were scribbled
the lines of a lampoon; that also was in 8.7. Suetonius
gives us another snatch of a popular song relative to
Cæsar, in the same measure. Surely this goes to establish
the fact that the Roman populace had their own
folk-music, which was rhythmic, with tonal accent,
distinct from the fashionable music of the theatre.</p>

<p>Now, it is quite true that in Latin plays there was
singing, and, what is more, songs introduced. For
instance, in the <i>Captivi</i> of Plautus, in the third act,
Hegio comes on the stage singing&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“Quid est suavius quam</p>
<p class="pp6">Bene rem gerere bono publico, sicut feci<br />
Ego heri, quum eius hosce homines, ubi quisque</p>
<p class="pp10">Vident me hodie,” etc.</p>

<p class="pn1">But I defy any musician to set his song to anything
else but recitative; the metre is intricate and varied.</p>

<p>Now of rhythmic melody we have nothing more till
the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 386, when, at Milan, the Empress Justina
ordered that a church should be taken from the Catholics
and be delivered over to the Arians.</p>

<p>Thereupon S. Ambrose, the bishop, took up his abode
within the sacred building, that was also crowded by the
faithful, who held it as a garrison for some days. To
occupy the people Ambrose hastily scribbled down
some hymns&mdash;not at all in the old classic metres, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in rhythmic measure&mdash;and set them to sing these, no
doubt whatever, to familiar folk-airs. Thirteen of the
hymns of S. Ambrose remain. His favourite metre is&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“Te lucis ante terminum,”</p>

<p class="pn1">our English Long Measure. And what is more, the
traditional tunes to which he set these hymns have
been handed down, so that in these we probably possess
the only ascertainable relics of Roman folk-airs of the
fourth century, and who can tell of how much earlier?</p>

<p>Now, in ancient days the people were wont to crowd
to church on the vigils of festivals and spend the night
in or outside the churches in singing and dancing. To
drive out the profane and indelicate songs, the clergy
composed hymns and set them to the folk-airs then in
vogue. These hymns came into use more and more,
and at length simply forced their way into the services
of the Church&mdash;but were not recognised as forming a
legitimate part of it till the tenth century.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical hymns for the people, after having
been composed in barbarous Latin, led by a second step
to the vernacular Romance. The transition was easy,
and was, indeed, inevitable. And in music, recitative
fell into disfavour, and formal music, to which poetry is
the handmaid, came into popular usage exclusively;
recitative lingering on only in the liturgy of the Church.
The Provençal language was now on its way to
becoming fixed and homogeneous; the many local
variations found in the several districts tending to
effacement.</p>

<p>Then came the golden age of the Troubadours, who
did more than any before to fix the tongue. In
the twelfth century the little courts of the Provençal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
nobles were renowned for gallantry. In fact, the knights
and barons and counts of the South plumed themselves
on setting the fashion to Christendom. In the South
there was none of that rivalry existing elsewhere
between the knights in their castles and the citizens in
the towns. In every other part of Western Europe the
line of demarcation was sharp between the chivalry
and the bourgeoisie. Knighthood could only be conferred
on one who was noble and who owned land. It
was otherwise in the South; the nobility and the commercial
class were on the best of terms, and one great
factor in this fusion was the Troubadour, who might
spring from behind a counter as well as from a knightly
castle.</p>

<p>The chivalry of the South, and the Troubadour, evolved
the strange and, to our ideas, repulsive theory of love,
which was, for a time, universally accepted. What
originated it was this:</p>

<p>In the south of France women could possess fiefs
and all the authority and power attaching to them.
From this political capacity of women it followed that
marriages were contracted most ordinarily by nobles
with an eye to the increase of their domains. Ambition
was the dominant passion, and to that morality, sentiment,
inclination, had to give way and pass outside their
matrimonial plans. Consequently, in the feudal caste,
marriages founded on such considerations were regarded
as commercial contracts only, and led to a most
curious moral and social phenomenon.</p>

<p>The idea was formed of love as a sentiment, from
which every sensual idea was excluded, in which, on the
woman’s side, all was condescension and compassion,
on the man’s all submission and homage. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lady must have her devoted knight or minstrel&mdash;her
lover, in fact, who could not and must not be her
husband; and every man who aspired to be courteous
must have his mistress.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There are,” says a Troubadour, “four degrees in Love:
the first is hesitancy, the second is suppliancy, the third is
acceptance, and the fourth is friendship. He who would love
a lady and goes to court her, but does not venture on addressing
her, is in the stage of Hesitancy. But if the lady gives
him any encouragement, and he ventures to tell her of his
pains, then he has advanced to the stage of Suppliant. And
if, after speaking to his lady and praying her, she retains him
as her knight, by the gift of ribbons, gloves, or girdle, then he
enters on the grade of Acceptance. And if, finally, it pleases
the lady to accord to her loyal accepted lover so much as a
kiss, then she has elevated him to Friendship.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the life of a knight the contracting of such
an union was a most solemn moment. The ceremony
by which it was sealed was formulated on that
in which a vassal takes oath of fealty to a sovereign.
Kneeling before the lady, with his hands joined
between hers, the knight devoted himself and all his
powers to her, swore to serve her faithfully to death,
and to defend her to the utmost of his power from
harm and insult. The lady, on her side, accepted these
services, promised in return the tenderest affections of
her heart, put a gold ring on his finger as pledge of
union, and then raising him gave him a kiss, always the
first, and often the only one he was to receive from her.
An incident in the Provençal romance of Gerard de
Roussillon shows us just what were the ideas prevalent
as to marriage and love at this time. Gerard was
desperately in love with a lady, but she was moved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
ambition to accept in his place Charles Martel, whom
the author makes into an Emperor. Accordingly
Gerard marries the sister of the Empress on the same
day. No sooner is the double ceremonial complete
than,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Gerard led the queen aside under a tree, and with her came
two counts and her sister (Gerard’s just-acquired wife).
Gerard spoke and said, ‘What will you say to me now, O wife
of an Emperor, as to the exchange I have made of you for a
very inferior article?’ ‘Do not say that,’ answered the
Queen; ‘say a worthy object, of high value, Sir. But it is
true that through you I am become Queen, and that out of
love for me you have taken my sister to wife. Be you my
witnesses, Counts Gervais and Bertelais, and you also, my
sister, and confidante of all my thoughts, and you, above all,
Jesus, my Redeemer; know all that I have given my love to
duke Gerard along with this ring and this flower. I love him
more than father and husband!’ Then they separated; but
their love always endured, without there ever being any harm
come of it, but only a tender longing and secret thoughts.”</p>

<p class="p1">The coolness of Gerard, before his just-received wife,
disparaging her, and swearing everlasting love to the
new-made Queen, the moment after they have left
church, is sufficiently astounding.</p>

<p>So completely was it an accepted theory that love
could not exist along with marriage, that it was held
that even if those who had been lovers married, union
<i>ipso facto</i> dissolved love. A certain knight loved a lady,
who, however, had set her affections on another. All
she could promise the former was that should she lose
her own true love, she would look to him. Soon after
this she married the lord of her heart, and at once the
discarded lover applied to be taken on as her servitor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The lady refused, saying that she had her lover&mdash;her
husband; and the controversy was brought before the
Court of Love. Eleanor of Poitiers presided, and pronounced
against the lady. She condemned her to take
on the knight as her lover, because she actually had
lost her own lover, by marrying him.</p>

<p>We probably form an erroneous idea as to the immorality
of these contracts, because we attach to the
idea of love a conception foreign to that accorded it by
the chivalry of Provence in the twelfth century. With
them it was a mystic exaltation, an idealising of a lady
into a being of superior virtue, beauty, spirituality.
And because it was a purely ideal relation it could not
subsist along with a material relation such as marriage.
It was because this connexion was ideal only that the
counts and viscounts and barons looked with so much
indifference, or even indulgence, on their wives contracting
it. There were exceptions, where the lady
carried her condescension too far. But the very extravagance
of terms employed towards the ladies is the
best possible evidence that the Troubadours knew them
very little, and by no means intimately. Bertram, to
Helena, was “a bright particular star,” but only so
because he was much away from Roussillon, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“So high above me</p>
<p class="pp6">In his bright radiance and collateral light<br />
Must I be computed, not in his sphere.”</p>

<p class="p1">When she became his wife she discovered that he was
a mere cub. Cœlia was no goddess to Strephon. So
the privileged “servant,” worshipped, and only could
frame his mind to worship, because held at a great
distance, too far to note the imperfections in temper,
in person, in mind, of the much-belauded lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A friend told me that he was staggered out of his
posture of worship to his newly acquired wife by seeing
her clean her teeth. It had not occurred to him that
her lovely pearls could need a toothbrush.</p>

<p>William de Balaun, a good knight and Troubadour,
loved and served Guillelmine de Taviac, wife of a
seigneur of that name. He debated in his mind which
was the highest felicity, winning the favour of a lady,
or, after losing it, winning it back again. He resolved
to put this question to the proof, so he affected the
sulks, and behaved to the lady with rudeness&mdash;would
not speak, turned his back on her. At first she endeavoured
to soothe him, but when that failed withdrew,
and would have no more to say to him. De Balaun
now changed his mood, and endeavoured to make her
understand that he was experimentalising in the Gai
Saber, that was all. She remained obdurate till a
mutual friend intervened. Then she consented to
receive William de Balaun again into her favour, if he
would tear out one of his nails and serve it up to her
on a salver along with a poem in praise of her beauty.
And on these terms he recovered his former place.</p>

<p>Geofrey Rudel had neither seen the Countess of
Tripoli nor cast his eyes on her portrait, but chose to
fall in love with her at the simple recital of her beauty
and virtue. For long he poured forth verses in her
honour; but at last, drawn to Syria by desire of seeing
her, he embarked, fell mortally ill on the voyage, and
arrived at Tripoli to expire; satisfied that he had
bought at this price the pleasure of casting his eyes
on the princess, and hearing her express sorrow that
he was to be snatched away.</p>

<p>In a great many cases, probably in the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cases, there was no amorous passion excited. It was
simply a case of bread and butter. The swarm of
knights and Troubadours that hovered about an exalted
lady, was drawn to her, not at all by her charms, but
by her table, kitchen, and cellar&mdash;in a word, by cupboard
love.</p>

<p>In their own little bastides they led a dull life, and
were very impecunious. If they could get some lady
of rank to accept their services, they obtained free
quarters in her castle, ate and drank of her best, and
received gratuities for every outrageously flattering
sonnet. If she were elderly and plain&mdash;that mattered
not, it rather favoured the acceptance, for she would
then not be nice in selecting her <i>cher ami</i>. All that
was asked in return was, that he should fetch her gloves,
hold her stirrup, fight against any one who spoke a
disparaging word, and turn heels over head to amuse
her on a rainy day.</p>

<p>A little poem by Pierre de Barjac is extant. He
loved and served a noble lady De Javac. One day she
gave him to understand that he was dismissed. He
retired, not a little surprised and mortified, but returned
a few days later with a poem, of which these are some
of the strophes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Lady, I come before you, frankly to say good-bye for ever.
Thanks for your favour in giving me your love and a merry
life, as long as it suited you. Now, as it no longer suits you,
it is quite right that you should pick up another friend who
will please you better than myself. I have naught against that.
We part on good terms, as though nothing had been between
us.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, because I seem sad, you may fancy that I am
speaking more seriously than usual; but that you are mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in this, I will convince you. I know well enough that you
have some one else in your eye. Well, so have I in mine&mdash;some
one to love after being quit of you. She will maintain
me; she is young, you are waxing old. If she be not quite
as noble as yourself, she is, at all events, far prettier and better
tempered.</p>

<p>“If our mutual oath of engagement is at all irksome to
your conscience, let us go before a priest&mdash;you discharge me,
and I will discharge you. Then each of us can loyally enter
on a new love affair. If I have ever done anything to annoy
you, forgive me; I, on my part, forgive you with all my heart;
and a forgiveness without heart is not worth much.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">During the winter these professional lovers resided at
the castles of the counts and viscounts. In the spring
they mounted their horses and wandered away, some
in quest of a little fighting, some to loiter in distant
courts, some to attend to their own farms and little
properties. Each as he left doubtless received a purse
from the lady he had served and sung, together with a
fresh pair of stockings, and with his linen put in order.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Love,” says Mr. Green, in his <i>History of the English
People</i>, “was the one theme of troubadour and trouveur;
but it was a love of refinement, of romantic follies, of scholastic
discussions, of sensuous enjoyment&mdash;a plaything rather than
a passion. Nature had to reflect the pleasant indolence of
man; the song of the minstrel moved through a perpetual
May-time; the grass was ever green; the music of the lark
and the nightingale rang out from field and thicket. There
was a gay avoidance of all that is serious, moral, or reflective
in man’s life. Life was too amusing to be serious, too piquant,
too sentimental, too full of interest and gaiety and chat.”</p>

<p class="p1">That this professional, sentimental love-making went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
beyond bounds occasionally is more than probable, for
human nature cannot be controlled by such a spider-web
system. It will break through. Every one knows the
story of William de Cabestaing, who loved and served
among others&mdash;for he was to one thing constant never&mdash;Sermonde,
wife of Raymond de Roussillon, whereupon
the husband had him murdered, and his heart
roasted and dished up at table. When Sermonde was
told what she had eaten, she threw herself out of a
window. But is the story true? Much the same tale
occurs thrice in Boccaccio; once of Sermonde, something
of the same in the Cup, and again in the Pot of
Basil; moreover, the same tale is told of others.</p>

<p>This artificial theory of love was carried to the Court
of Naples, and to that of Frederick II. at Palermo. It
brought after it an inevitable reaction, and this found
its fullest expression in Boccaccio.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“All the mediæval enthusiasms,” says Mr. Addington
Symonds, “are reviewed and criticised from the standpoint
of the Florentine bottega and piazza. It is as though the
bourgeois, not content with having made nobility a crime,
were bent upon extinguishing its spirit. The tale of Agilult
vulgarises the chivalrous conception of love ennobling men
of low estate, by showing how a groom, whose heart is set
upon a queen, avails himself of opportunity. Tancred
burlesques the knightly reverence for a stainless scutcheon,
by the extravagance of his revenge. The sanctity of the
Thebaid, that ascetic dream of purity and self-renunciation
for God’s service, is made ridiculous by Ailbech. Sen
Ciappelletto brings contempt upon the canonisation of saints.
The confessional, the worship of relics, the priesthood, and
the monastic orders, are derided with the deadliest persiflage.
Christ Himself is scoffed at in a jest which points the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
indecent of these tales. Marriage offers a never-failing theme
for scorn; and when, by way of contrast, the novelist paints
an ideal wife, he runs into such hyperboles that the very
patience of Griselda is a satire on its dignity.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<span class="mid">MARSEILLES</span></h2>

<p class="pch">The arrival of the Phocœans&mdash;The story of Protis and Gyptis&mdash;Siege of

<p class="drop-cap16">AS has been already stated, Massilia, or Marseilles,
was originally a Phœnician trading station. Then
it was occupied by the Phocœans from Asia Minor. It
came about in this fashion.</p>

<p>In the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 599 a few Phocœean vessels, under the
guidance of an adventurer called Eumenes, arrived in the
bay of Marseilles. The first care of the new arrivals was
to place themselves under the protection of the Ligurians,
and they sent an ambassador, a young Greek named
Protis, with presents to the native chief, Nann, at Arles.
By a happy coincidence Protis arrived on the day upon
which Nann had assembled the warriors of his tribe,
and had brought forth his daughter, Gyptis, to choose a
husband among them. The arrival of the young Greek
was a veritable <i>coup de théâtre</i>. He took his place at
the banquet. His Greek beauty, his graceful form and
polished manners, so different from the ruggedness and
uncouthness of the Ligurians, impressed the damsel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and going up to him, she presented him with the goblet
of wine, which was the symbol of betrothal. Protis put
it to his lips, and the alliance was concluded.</p>

<p>The legend is doubtless mythical, but it shows us, disguised
under the form of a tale, what actually took
place, that the Ionian settlers did contract marriages
with the natives. But the real great migration took
place in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 542, fifty-seven years later.</p>

<p>Harpagus, the general of Cyrus, was ravaging Asia
Minor, and he invested Phocœa. As the Ionians in the
town found that they could hold out no longer, their
general, Dionysos, thus addressed them:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Our affairs are in a critical state, and we have to decide at
once whether we are to remain free, or to bow our necks in
servitude, and be treated as runaway slaves. Now, if you be
willing to undergo some hardships, you will be able to secure
your freedom.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then he advised that they should lade their vessels
with all their movable goods, put on them their wives
and children, and leave their native land.</p>

<p>Soon after this Harpagus saw a long line of vessels,
their sails swelled with the wind, and the water glancing
from their oars, issue from the port and pass away over
the blue sea towards the western sun. All the inhabitants
had abandoned the town. Dionysos had heard a good
report of the Ligurian coast, and thither he steered, and
was welcomed by his countrymen who had settled there
half a century before.</p>

<p>But the Ligurians did not relish this great migration,
and they resolved on massacring the new arrivals, and
of taking advantage of the celebration of the Floral
Games for carrying out their plan. Accordingly they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sent in their weapons through the gates of Marseilles,
heaped over with flowers and boughs, and a party of
Ligurians presented themselves unarmed, as flocking in
to witness the festival. But other Ligurian girls beside
Gyptis had fallen in love with and had contracted
marriages with the Greeks, and one of these betrayed
the plot. Accordingly the Phocœans closed their gates,
and drawing the weapons from under the wreaths of
flowers, slaughtered the Ligurians with their own arms.</p>

<p>From Marseilles the Greeks spread along the coast
and founded numerous other towns, and, penetrating
inland, made of Arles a Greek city.</p>

<p>In the civil war that broke out between Cæsar and
Pompey, Marseilles, unhappily for her, threw in her lot
with the latter. Cæsar, at the head of his legions, appeared
before the gates, and found them closed against
him. It was essential for Cæsar to obtain possession of
the town and port, and he invested it. Beyond the
walls was a sacred wood in which mysterious rites were
performed, and which was held in the highest veneration
by the Massiliots. Cæsar ordered that it should be
hewn down; but his soldiers shrank from profaning it.
Then snatching up an axe, he exclaimed, “Fear not, I
take the crime upon myself!” and smote at an oak.
Emboldened by his words and action, the soldiers now
felled the trees, and out of them Cæsar fashioned twelve
galleys and various machines for the siege.</p>

<p>Obliged to hurry into Spain, he left some of his best
troops under his lieutenants C. Trebonius and D.
Brutus to continue operations against Marseilles; the
former was in command of the land forces, and Brutus
was admiral of the improvised fleet. The people of
Marseilles were now reinforced by Domitius, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Pompey’s most trusted generals, and they managed to
scrape together a fleet of seventeen galleys.</p>

<p>This fleet received orders to attack that of Brutus,
and it shot out of the harbour. Brutus awaited it,
drawn up in crescent form. His ships were cumbrous,
and not manned by such dextrous navigators as the
Greeks. But he had furnished himself with grappling
irons, and when the Greek vessels came on, he flung out
his harpoons, caught them, and brought the enemy to
the side of his vessels, so that the fight became one of
hand to hand as on platforms, and the advantage of
the nautical skill of the Massiliots was neutralised.
They lost nine galleys, and the remnant with difficulty
escaped back into port.</p>

<p>The besieged, though defeated, were not disheartened.
They sent to friendly cities for aid, they seized on
merchant vessels and converted them into men of war,
and Pompey, who knew the importance of Marseilles,
sent Nasidius with sixteen triremes to the aid of the
invested town.</p>

<p>Again their fleet sallied forth. This time they were
more wary, and backed when they saw the harpoons
shot forth, so that the grappling irons fell innocuously
into the sea. Finding all his efforts to come to close
quarters with the enemy unavailing, Brutus signalled to
his vessels to draw up in hollow square, prows outward.</p>

<p>Nasidius, who was in command of the Massiliot fleet,
had he used his judgment, should have waited till a
rough sea had opened the joints of the opposed ranks,
and broken the formation. Instead of doing this, he
endeavoured by ramming the sides to break the square,
with the result that he damaged his own vessels, which
were the lightest and least well protected at the bows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
far more than he did the enemy. Seeing that his plan
was unsuccessful, he was the first to turn his galley
about and fly. Five of the Massiliot vessels were sunk,
four were taken, and those that returned to the port
were seriously damaged.</p>

<p>On land the besieged had been more successful; they
had repelled all attempts of Trebonius to storm the
place. When he mined, they countermined, or let water
into his galleries, and drowned those working in them.
When he rolled up his huge wooden towers against the
walls, the besieged rushed forth and set them on fire.</p>

<p>But now a worse enemy than Cæsar’s army appeared
against them&mdash;the plague. Reduced to the utmost extremity,
the Massiliots saw that their only hope was in
the clemency of the conqueror. Nasidius had fled.
Now Domitius departed; but not till he saw that surrender
was inevitable. Cæsar had arrived in the camp
of the besiegers. Marseilles opened her gates, and Cæsar
treated the city with great magnanimity. But, ruined
by the expenses of the long siege, without a fleet, its
commerce gone, depopulated by war and disease, long
years were required for the effacement of the traces of
so many misfortunes.</p>

<p>Now I must go back through many centuries to
speak of a most remarkable man, “the Humboldt
of Antiquity,” who was a native of Marseilles, and
who was the first to reveal to the world the existence
of the Isle of Britain. His name was Pythias, and he
lived four centuries before the birth of Christ. The
Greeks had vague and doubtful traditions of the existence,
far away in the North, of a land where the
swans sang, and where lived a people “at the back of
the north wind,” in perpetual sunshine, and worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the sun, offering to it hecatombs of wild asses, and
whence came the most precious of metals&mdash;tin, without
which no bronze could be fabricated. The way to this
mysterious land was known only to the Carthaginians,
and was kept as a profound secret from the Phocœan
Greeks, who had occupied their colony at Marseilles, and
were engrossing their commerce. The Phœnicians of
Tyre and Sidon, and of Carthage, had secured a monopoly
of the mineral trade. Spain was the Mexico of
the antique world. It was fabled that the Tagus rolled
over sands of gold, and the Guadiana over a floor of
silver. The Phœnician sailors, it was reported, replaced
their anchors of iron with masses of silver; and that the
Iberians employed gold for mangers, and silver for their
vats of beer; that the pebbles of their moors were pure
tin, and that the Iberian girls “streamed” the rivers in
wicker cradles, washing out tin and gold, lead and silver.
But as more was known of Spain, it was ascertained
that these legends were true only in a limited degree;
tin and silver and lead were there, but not to the amount
fabled. Therefore it was concluded that the treasure
land was farther to the north. Not by any means, by
no bribery, by no persuasion, not by torture, could the
secret be wrung from the Phœnicians whence they procured
the inestimable treasure of tin. Only it was known
that much of it came from the North, and by a trade
route through Gaul to the Rhone; but also, and mainly,
by means of vessels of the Phœnicians passing through
the Straits into the unknown ocean beyond.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the merchants of Marseilles resolved on
sending an expedition in quest of this mysterious Hyperborean
land, and they engaged the services of Pythias,
an eminent mathematician of the city, who had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
made himself famous by his measurement of the declination
of the ecliptic, and by the calculation of the latitude
of Marseilles. At the same time the merchants despatched
another expedition to explore the African
coast, under the direction of one Euthymes, another
scientist of their city. Unhappily, the record of the
voyage of this latter is lost; but the diary of Pythias,
very carefully kept, has been preserved in part, quoted
by early geographers who trusted him, and by Strabo,
who poured scorn on his discoveries because they controverted
his preconceived theories.</p>

<p>Pythias published his diary in two books, entitled
<i>The Circuit of the World</i> and <i>Commentaries concerning
the Ocean</i>. From the fragments that remain we can
trace his course. Leaving Marseilles, he coasted round
Spain to Brittany; from Brittany he struck Kent, and
visited other parts of Britain; then from the Thames he
travelled to the mouths of the Rhine, passed round Jutland,
entered the Baltic, and went to the mouth of the
Vistula; thence out of the Baltic and up the coast of
Norway to the Arctic Circle; thence he struck west, and
reached the Shetlands and the North of Scotland, and
coasted round the British Isles till again he reached
Armorica; and so to the estuary of the Garonne, whence
he journeyed by land to Marseilles.</p>

<p>Pythias remained for some time in Britain, the country
to which, as he said, he paid more attention than to any
other which he visited in the course of his travels; and
he claimed to have investigated all the accessible parts
of the Island, and to have traced the eastern side
throughout. He arrived in Kent early in the summer,
and remained there until harvest time, and he again
returned after his voyage to the Arctic Circle. He says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that there was plenty of wheat grown in the fields of
Britain, but that it was thrashed out in barns, and not
on unroofed floors as in the sunny climate of Marseilles.
He says that a drink to which the Britons were partial
was composed of wheat and honey&mdash;in a word, metheglin.
It is greatly to be regretted that of this interesting and
honestly written diary only scraps remain.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The old city of Phœnicians and Phocœans occupied
that portion of the present town lying between the sea
and the ancient port, and the walls cut across from the
Anse de la Joliette, mounted the Butte des Carmes and
descended to the head of the Vieux-port. The Butte
des Moulins was the Acropolis, and on it stood temples
of the gods of Carthage and Greece. The sea-face was
formerly very different from what it is now. Cæsar
speaks of Marseilles being washed by the sea on three
sides. The sea has eaten away a very large portion of
the peninsula. The cathedral, La Major, was not
formerly on the quay; till the end of the eighteenth
century its principal portal faced the sea. At the close
of that century, so much of the town having been washed
away, and so sapped was the rock on that side, that
a doorway had to be opened on the landside. An old
chapel existing in 1202 stood at a point now 250 feet
from the land. Recent works, the formation of a succession
of basins, have arrested this degradation of the
coast, and have regained some of the lost land.</p>

<p>Marseilles lies in an amphitheatre, but this is only
realised when the city is approached from the sea. To
those arriving by rail it appears to be a town scattered
over a series of hills, very irregular and of a very confused
plan. All that portion of the town that lies south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Vieux-port, about the Palais de Justice to where
the hill rises, was formerly morass; the houses here have
no cellars, and are built, like Amsterdam, on piles. Above
the Bassin de Carinage rises the Church of S. Victor,
built in the eleventh and extended in the thirteenth
century. The towers and ramparts were erected by
William de Grimoard in 1350. He had been prior of
the monastery of S. Victor, and afterwards became pope
under the name of Urban V. All this portion of rising
ground to the south of the old harbour seems to have
been the refuge of the first Christians. Excavations
made in extending the basin laid bare vestiges of catacombs
of a very early period, earlier, in fact, in some
cases than the Christian era. In the fourth century the
monk Cassian founded a monastery above these catacombs.
It was destroyed by the Saracens and rebuilt,
and became a vastly wealthy foundation. The monastery
on one side of the port, and the cathedral with its appurtenances
on the other, were not under the jurisdiction
of the municipal authorities of Marseilles; but each had
its own town of dependencies under separate government.</p>

<p>What remains of this famous abbey bears an aspect
of a citadel rather than of a church. It is an extraordinary
jumble of parts, and from without looks as if it
were wholly planless.</p>

<p>When, and through whom, Christianity was planted in
Marseilles, is unknown; for the tradition of the apostleship
there of Lazarus, whom Christ raised from the
dead, must be dismissed as idle fable. The traditional
tale is as follows, but there is no earlier authority for it
than a legend of the twelfth century, and this is mere
religious romance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>When persecution broke out in Jerusalem, Martha,
Mary Magdalen, a Bishop Maximin, and a Deacon
Parmenas, and Lazarus, took a boat and sailed merrily
over the sea till they came to Provence. Maximin
settled at Aix. Mary Magdalen retired to the cave
La Sainte Beaume, and Martha killed a dragon at
Tarascon, and established herself in its lair. Lazarus
remained at Marseilles, and became its first bishop.</p>

<p>The first bishop of Marseilles known to history is
Orestius, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 314; and not a particle of evidence worth
a rush exists to substantiate the story of Lazarus,
Martha, and Mary, having ever come to Provence.</p>

<p>The street called Cannebière leads to the Vieux-port.
Cannebière means a rope-walk, and here were situated
the workshops of those who supplied the vessels with
cordage and sails. When the old port was being cleaned
out, an ancient galley was found at a depth of fifteen
feet, built of cedar wood, with coins earlier, contemporary
with, and slightly later than Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not to be wondered at that not a scrap
of ancient Massilia should remain above ground, not a
fragment of city wall, of temple, or of amphitheatre, for
the valleys have been choked up to the depth of eighteen
to twenty feet, and the summits of the rounded hills
have been shorn off. But to obtain some idea of the
past, the Archæological Museum at the extremity of
the Prado should be visited. One room is devoted to
the remains of pagan Massilia, another to the Christian
sarcophagi discovered in the catacombs of S. Victor.</p>

<p>The siege of Marseilles by the army of Cæsar was by
no means the only trial of that description the city had
to undergo. The next most serious investment was
that by the Constable de Bourbon, who had transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
his services to Charles V. and fought against his
sovereign, Francis I. Pope Leo X. had stirred up the
emperor and had effected a coalition of England,
Austria, Milan, Venice, Florence, and Genoa, against
France. Charles despatched the Constable de Bourbon
against Marseilles, and he appeared before it on
August 19th, 1524, but met with a stubborn resistance.</p>

<p>Furious at not being able to obtain a surrender, he
ordered a general assault, and promised his soldiers to
suffer them to pillage the town at their own sweet will.
On September 25th the besiegers attacked the walls,
managed to beat down a portion and form a breach,
through which they poured exultant. But bitter was
their disappointment when they discovered that the
besieged had raised a second wall within, in crescent
form, on the top of which was the garrison, armed with
culverins, and that at the points of junction of the new
wall with the old were planted cannon which, with
their cross fire, could mow down all who rushed into
the semilunar area. The Spanish battalions hesitated,
but were urged forward by their captains, and a frightful
carnage ensued. The space was heaped with dead,
and the baffled Constable, with rage in his heart,
running short of ammunition and provisions, was forced
to raise the siege and retire, on the night of September
25th.</p>

<p>But that which has proved to Marseilles more fatal
than sieges has been the plague, which has reappeared
time after time, becoming almost endemic. The unsanitary
condition of the town, the absence of wholesome
water, invited its presence. The magnificent
works of the canal of Marseilles now conduct to the
town the waters of the Durance. This canal was constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
between 1837 and 1848, extends a length of
ninety-five miles, and is carried through tunnels and
over aqueducts. The body of water thus conducted to
Marseilles not only supplies the precious liquid for
drinking and bathing, but also sends rills to water the
gardens which would otherwise be barren. How
necessary this great work was may be judged from
the number of deaths at Marseilles at the outbreak of
the plague in 1720, when from 40,000 to 50,000 persons
succumbed.</p>

<p>Amidst the general despair, selfishness, and depravity
that then manifested itself, the Bishop Belzunce, some
of his clergy, and the governor of the town, showed
noble self-possession and devotion.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The physicians sent to Marseilles by the Government,”
says Méry, “on arriving found in the place over 20,000 dead
and nine to ten thousand sick or dying. The frightful
spectacle so affected them that they could hardly eat. In
traversing the town, in places they could hardly step without
encountering heaps of corpses. The plague-stricken felt a
flicker of hope on seeing doctors approach, but this soon died
out. Fathers and mothers dragged their children into the
streets, and abandoned them after placing a jug of water at
their side. Children exhibited a revolting lack of feeling.
All generous sentiments had been paralysed by the hand of
death. The mortality was so great and rapid in its march
that the corpses piled up before the houses, and in the church
porches, indeed everywhere, empested the air. In the heat,
the bodies rapidly putrified and dissolved, falling apart in
strips. All were naked; the sick were covered by a few rags.
Women half-clothed appealed for a drop of water, pointing to
the fetid rill that trickled down the gutter; and as no one
attended to them, they used their failing powers to crawl to it,
often with their babes at their breasts, to dip their lips in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
foul stream. Death was preceded by frightful spasms. The
number of deaths increased to such an extent that it was not
possible to bury the dead. Bewilderment took possession of
men. Those of the inhabitants who had not been infected
wandered about, not knowing whither to go, but avoiding one
another. Others converted their houses into fortresses, as
though disposed to maintain a siege; others fled to their
country villas; others went on board ship; but the plague
pursued them everywhere.</p>

<p>“In these days of calamity, the heart of man was shown in
all its nakedness, and revealed all its baseness, ignoble inclinations,
as well as its virtues and devotion. Those especially
belonging to the lowest social beds, who live in fear of the
laws, gave themselves up to frightful excesses. The galley
slaves, to whom was entrusted the burial of the dead, drew the
tumbrils heaped with corpses with a mocking callousness;
murdering the sick so as to rob them; flinging those ill along
with those dead together, indifferently, into the pits dug to
receive the bodies. The civic functionaries, the employés,
even priests, deserted their posts, and the monks of S. Victor
enclosed themselves within their fortress. But there were
others, who presented a striking contrast to these men.
Priests came hurrying to the empested town from all parts to
shut themselves in within this circle of death. Their zeal was
stimulated by the sublime self-devotion of Belzunce, bishop of
Marseilles. The fear of death never chilled his charity. He
hurried through the street, seated himself by the dying, bowed
over them to hear their confessions, and the plague spared
him as he executed these acts of humanity.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Pope referred to this bishop in the lines:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Why drew Marseilles’ good bishop purer breath,<br />
When nature sicken’d and each gale was death?”</p>

<p class="p1">The pestilence, which had broken out in the spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
continued to rage till September, but abated after a
violent storm, and disappeared in November. At the
Revolution the merchant aristocracy did not relish the
movement, fearing an attack on property; but the lower
classes were maddened with enthusiasm for the “rights
of man,” which meant the right to chop off the head of
every one of whom they were envious, and of appropriating
to themselves the savings of the industrious.
Marseilles furnished, from the dregs of its population,
the bands of assassins which marched to Paris, screaming
forth Rouget de l’Isle’s hymn, which thenceforth
took the name of the Marseillaise; and these bands
were foremost in the September massacres in Paris.</p>

<p>The Reign of Terror at Marseilles itself, under the
infamous Fréron and Barras, saw four hundred heads
fall upon the scaffold, to the shouts of the mob, “Ça ira!
Plus la République coupe de têtes, plus la République
s’affermit.”</p>

<p>At Marseilles, Joseph Bonaparte, when acting there as
War Commissioner, met the sisters Clary. At his very
first visit he had been billeted on the soap-boiler, and
now, when again in the place, he lost his heart to one
of the girls. Both were destined to be queens. Julie
(Marie) was born in 1777, and married Joseph in 1794.
In 1797 Joseph was sent as ambassador to Rome, and
he took with him his wife and her sister Eugenie Désirée;
she was engaged to be married to General Duphot, who
was with Joseph in Rome. On the eve of their wedding
a disturbance took place in the streets of the Eternal
City, caused by a rising of the revolutionary party.
Duphot ran among them, whether to encourage them
or dissuade them from violence is uncertain; but he
was shot by the Papal soldiery in the tumult. Six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
months later Eugenie Désirée dried her tears in
her bridal veil, when she married the saddler’s son
Bernadotte, who was destined to wear the crown of
Sweden.</p>

<p>Joseph became King of Naples and then of Spain.
Madame de Genlis, who knew both the young women,
has a good word to say for them. Of Julie, the wife of
Joseph, she says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“She always reminded me of the princesses of the Old
Court, and she had all the bearing and carriage of the last
princess of Conti. If Heaven had chosen to cause her to be
born on a throne it could not have rendered her more suitable,
with her graciousness, a great quality, which should characterise
all princes, and which with her was perfected by being united
to the most sincere piety, and hatred of all ostentation.”</p>

<p class="p1">Of Eugenie, who became Queen of Norway and
Sweden, she says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I had the honour to make the acquaintance of Madame
Bernadotte, sister of the Queen of Spain, who then had all
the charms of a graceful figure, and the most agreeable
manners. I was struck with the harmony that existed between
her amiable face, her conversation, and her mind.”</p>

<p class="p1">Addison, who sailed from Marseilles on December 12th,
1699 (Macaulay says the date should be 1700), and
skirted the Ligurian coast to Genoa, was surprised and
delighted to see</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">“the mountains cover’d with green Olive-trees, or laid out in
beautiful gardens, which gave us a great Variety of pleasing
Prospects, even in the Depth of Winter. The most uncultivated
of them produce abundance of sweet Plants, as Wild-Thyme,
Lavender, Rosemary, Balm and Myrtle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In his “Letter from Italy” he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“See how the golden groves around me smile,<br />
That shun the coast of Britain’s stormy isle,<br />
Or when transplanted and preserv’d with care,<br />
Curse the cold clime, and starve in Northern air.<br />
Here kindly warmth their mounting juice ferments,<br />
To nobler tastes, and more exalted scents:<br />
Ev’n the rough rocks with tender myrtle bloom,<br />
And trodden weeds send out a rich perfume.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AIX is perhaps the most dejected of cities. At one
time the life blood of the empire poured through
it. The great road that left the Flaminian gate of
Rome, passed along the coast of the Ligurian Gulf,
crossed the shoulder of the Alps at La Turbie, and
then, going through Nice and by Cannes, reached
Fréjus. At that point it turned inland, left the sea
behind, and made direct for Aix. Thence it stretched
away to Arles, and from that city radiated the routes to
Spain, throughout Gaul, and to the Rhine. Through
the market passed all the trade of the West; through
it tramped the legions for the conquest of Britain, and
the defence of the Rhenish frontier; through it travelled
the treasure for the pay of the soldiery; through it
streamed the lines of captives for the slave market at
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>But now, Aix is on no artery of communication. To
reach it, one most go in a loitering and roundabout
fashion by branch lines, on which run no express trains,
in company with oxen in pens and trucks of coal.</p>

<p>Marseilles has drained away the traffic that formerly
ebbed and flowed through Aix, leaving it listless and
lifeless. But if we desire relics and reminiscences of
the past we must not omit a visit to Aix.</p>

<p>Aquæ Sextiæ owes its foundation to Sextius Calvinus,
in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 124. The town has thrice shifted its site. The
old Ligurian fortified town was on the heights of
Entremont, three kilometres to the north&mdash;and traces
of it remain, but what its name was we do not know.
After the defeat of the Ligurians, Sextius Calvinus
planted the Roman town about the hot springs; but
the modern town lies to the east. After his victory
over the Ambrons and Teutons Marius rested here
and adorned the town with monuments, and led water
to it by the aqueduct, of which fragments remain.
Cæsar planted a colony here, and the place enjoyed
great prosperity. It was sacked and destroyed by the
Saracens in 731, and but slowly recovered from its
ashes. From the thirteenth century the counts of Provence
held their court at Aix, and here lived and
painted and sang good King Réné, of whom more
presently.</p>

<p>Aix first rises to notice conspicuously through the
defeat of the Ambro-Teutons by Marius <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 102. I
have described the campaign at some length in my book
<i>In Troubadour Land</i>, as I went over the whole of the
ground carefully. Here I will but sum up the story
briefly.</p>

<p>The Cimbri from what is now Jutland, the Teutons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and the Ambrons, driven from their northern lands by
an inundation of the sea, so it was reported, more probably
drawn south by desire of reaching fertile and
warmer seats than the bleak wastes of Northern Germany,
crossed the Rhine to the number of 300,000
fighting men, accompanied by their wives and children,
and moved south. All Gaul, and even Rome, trembled
before them, and the Senate despatched the Consul
Papirius Carbo against them. Having occupied the
defiles of the Alps, the Consul opened negotiations with
the barbarians, who pleaded to have lands allotted to
them. True to the unscrupulous principles of Rome,
in dealing with an enemy, he proposed an armistice,
which was accepted, and, profiting by this, he fell
treacherously on the enemy by night, when least
expected by the barbarians, who relied on his pacific
assurances. But the Cimbri, though taken at a disadvantage,
rallied and drove the legions back in disorder.
On his return to Rome, Carbo was subjected to
accusations by M. Antonius, and put an end to his life
by drinking a solution of vitriol. Instead of profiting by
this great victory to enter Italy, the horde retraced its
steps and turned towards Illyria and Thrace; after
devastating these, they again reappeared in Gaul on the
right bank of the Rhone, laden with spoils. Julius
Silanus, governor of the province, hastened to block
their course, and the barbarians again asked to be
granted lands on which to settle, offering in return to
place their arms at the service of Rome. Silanus
referred the proposal to the Senate. The reply was
one of insolent refusal and defiance. This so exasperated
the Cimbri and Teutons that they resolved on
crossing the Rhone and exacting at the point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sword what had been refused as a voluntary concession.
In vain did a Roman army endeavour to dispute with
them the passage of the river. They crossed, fell on
the Romans, and slaughtered them.</p>

<p>After this great success, the barbarians, instead of
pursuing their advantage, spread through the province
and formed an alliance with the Volci Tectosages, who
had their capital at Toulouse. Then they hurried towards
Northern Gaul. The consul Cœpio was sent
to chastise the Volci for their defection, and he took and
pillaged Toulouse. The Cimbri and Teutons, on hearing
of this, retraced their steps and confronted Cœpio. But a
year was allowed to pass without any decisive action
being fought.</p>

<p>In the meantime a fresh army had been raised in
Rome, and despatched to the aid of Cœpio, under
the command of Manlius. In a fit of jealousy Cœpio
retired to the left bank, encamped apart, and refused
to hold any communication with Manlius; and, that he
might have an opportunity of finishing the war himself,
he pitched his quarters between Manlius and the enemy.
At this juncture, with such a formidable host threatening,
the utmost prudence and unanimity were needed
by the two commanders; this the soldiers perceived,
and they compelled Cœpio, against his will, to unite his
forces with those of Manlius. But this did not mend
matters. They quarrelled again, and again separated.
The barbarians, who were informed as to the condition
of affairs, now fell on one army and then on the other,
and utterly routed both. Eighty thousand Roman
soldiers and forty thousand camp followers perished;
only ten men are said to have escaped the slaughter.
It was one of the most crushing defeats the Romans had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ever sustained, and the day on which it happened,
October 6th, became one of the black days in the
Roman calendar.</p>

<p>This overwhelming victory opened to the barbarians
the gates of Italy. It was, however, decided by them
to ravage Spain before invading Italy. The whole
course of proceedings on their part was marked by
a series of fatal blunders. Accordingly they crossed the
Pyrenees, but met with such stubborn resistance from
the Iberians that they withdrew.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rome had recalled Marius from Africa,
where he had triumphed over Jugurtha, King of
Numidia, along with some of his victorious legions; and
to him was entrusted the defence of Italy. He hastily
raised a new army, hurried into the province, crossed
the <i>crau</i>, and planted himself at the extreme western
end of the chain of Les Alpines at Ernaginum, now
S. Gabriel, whence he could watch the enemy; and
whilst there he employed the soldiery in digging a
canal from the sea to the Durance, by means of which
his camp could be supplied from Marseilles with munitions
of war and provisions.</p>

<p>The Cimbri and Teutons, on leaving Spain, divided
their forces. They decided that the Cimbri should cross
into the plains of Italy by the passes of the Noric Alps,
whereas the Ambrons and Teutons should advance
across the Maritime Alps by the Col de Tende.</p>

<p>Marius remained inert, and observed the enemy cross
the Rhone without making an effort to prevent the
passage, to the surprise and indignation of his troops.
The barbarians in vain attempted to draw him into
an engagement. Then they defiled along the Roman
road to the north of Les Alpines, passing under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
palisades of the camp, shouting derisively, “We are on
our way to Rome! Have you any messages for your
wives and children?” Six days were spent in the
march past.</p>

<p>With difficulty Marius restrained his men. Only
when the last of the Ambrons, who brought up the
rear, had gone by did Marius break up his camp. He
had along with him his wife, Julia, and a Syrian
sorceress named Martha. This woman, gorgeously
attired, wearing a mitre, covered with chains of gold,
and holding a javelin hung with ribbons, was now produced
before the soldiery, and, falling into an ecstasy,
she prophesied victory to the Roman arms. Marius
now moved east, following the horde, keeping, however,
to the high ground, the summit of the limestone cliffs,
and he came suddenly upon the Ambrons at Les Milles,
four miles to the south of Aix. At this point red sandstone
heights stand above the little river Are, and from
under the rocks ooze innumerable streams. Here the
Ambrons were bathing, when the Roman legionaries
appeared above.</p>

<p>Marius saw that the Ambrons had become detached
from the Teutons, who were pushing on to Aix. He
had now no occasion to restrain his soldiers, who poured
down the hill and cut the enemy to pieces.</p>

<p>Then he thrust on in pursuit of the Teutons. He
knew the ground thoroughly. The road beyond Aix
ran through a basin&mdash;a plain bordered by mountain
heights, those on the north sheer precipices of yellow
and pink limestone, those on the south not abrupt, and
clothed with coppice and box shrubs. He detached
Claudius Marcellus to make a circuit to the north of
the limestone range, with the cavalry, and to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
up a position where the road emerges from the
basin, at its eastern limit. He, with the main body of
his army, by forced marches outstripped the Teutons,
be moving to the south, out of sight in the brushwood,
and came out where stands now the town of Trets.
Thence he advanced down the slope towards the plain,
which is red as blood with sandstone and clay, and
where were tile works, Ad Tegulata. The Teutons had
already encamped, when they saw the Romans. An
engagement at once began. Whilst it was in progress,
Marcellus came down in their rear with his cavalry. The
result was a rout and a slaughter. Few were spared
among the fighting men. Over 100,000 were slaughtered
or made prisoners. Their wives and children, their
camp, and all their plunder, fell to the victors. So great
was the carnage, that the putrefying remains of the
Germans gave to the spot the name of Campi Putridi,
now corrupted into Pourrières.</p>

<p>A monument was afterwards erected where the
fiercest of the battle raged, the foundations of which
remain; and here was found the statue of Venus Victrix,
now in the Museum of Avignon; and at Pourrières
a triumphal arch was raised that still stands to commemorate
the victory. On the crag to the north,
commanding the field, a temple of Victory was erected
that in Christian times became a chapel of Ste. Victoire,
and the great deliverance in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 120 is still commemorated
by the lighting of bonfires on the heights,
and by a pilgrimage and mass said in the chapel on
March 23rd. A little convent was erected near the
chapel, that is now in ruins; the existing chapel dates
from only 1661. At the Revolution it was allowed
to fall to decay, but has since been restored. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
height of Ste. Victoire is noted as the resort of a
special kind of eagle, resembling the golden eagle, but
more thickset, and with “white scapulars.”</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Sir Walter Scott has
placed one of the scenes of <i>Anne of Geierstein</i> at the
Monastery of Ste. Victoire.</p>

<p>Near the chapel is the cavern of Lou Garagoul:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the midst of this cavernous thoroughfare,” says Sir
Walter, “is a natural pit or perforation of great, but unknown,
depth. A stone dropped into it is heard to dash from side
to side, until the noise of its descent, thundering from cliff to
cliff, dies away in distant and faint tinkling, less loud than that
of a sheep’s bell at a mile’s distance. The traditions of the
monastery annex wild and fearful recollections to a place in
itself sufficiently terrible. Oracles, it is said, spoke from
thence in pagan days by subterranean voices, arising from the
abyss.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The pit is, in fact, one of these <i>avens</i> so commonly
found on the limestone <i>causses</i>. The description is
somewhat overdrawn, but Sir Walter had never seen
the place, and all he knew of it was second hand.</p>

<p>With Aix, King Réné is inseparably associated, that
most unfortunate Mark Tapley of monarchs claiming
to be King of Jerusalem, Aragon, of Naples and of
Sicily, of Valencia, Majorca, Minorca, of Corsica and
Sardinia&mdash;to wear nine crowns, and yet not possessing a
rood of territory in one of them; Duke of Anjou and
Bar, but despoiled of his dukedoms, and reduced to only
his county of Provence.</p>

              <p class="pc wn"><i>From the Triptych in Aix Cathedral</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott pretty accurately describes him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">“Réné was a prince of very moderate parts, endowed with
a love of the fine arts, which he carried to extremity, and a
degree of good humour, which never permitted him to repine
at fortune, but rendered its possessor happy, when a prince of
keener feelings would have died of despair. This insouciant,
light-tempered, gay, and thoughtless disposition, conducted
Réné, free from all the passions which embitter life, and often
shorten it, to a hale and mirthful old age. Even domestic losses,
which often affect those who are proof against mere reverses of
fortune, made no deep impression on the feelings of this cheerful
old monarch. Most of his children had died young; Réné
took it not to heart. His daughter Margaret’s marriage with
the powerful Henry of England was considered a connexion
much above the fortunes of the King of the Troubadours.
But in the issue, instead of Réné deriving any splendour from
the match, he was involved in the misfortunes of his
daughter, and repeatedly obliged to impoverish himself to
supply her ransom.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the Cours Mirabeau at Aix may be seen a
statue of him by David of Angers, but it is worthless as
a bit of portraiture; which is indefensible, as several
genuine portraits of the king exist; one is in the
cathedral along with his second wife, in the triptych
of the Burning Bush; another in the MS. of Guarini’s
translation of Strabo, in the library at Albi; a third,
in private hands, has been engraved in the Count de
Quatrebarbe’s edition of King Réné’s works.</p>

<p>Réné has got into such a backwater of history that
probably not many English folk know more about him
than that he was the father of the unfortunate Margaret,
Queen of Henry VI., sketched for us by Shakespeare
in an unfavourable light, and more of him than what
Scott is pleased to say in <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>. But
no man has so taken hold of Provençal affection as has
Réné.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“If to the present day,” says a local historian, “the thought
of this King makes a Provençal heart beat with tender love,
it is due to this: that never was there a sovereign who showed
greater consideration for his people, was more sparing of their
blood and money, more desirous of promoting their happiness.
Simple and modest in all his tastes, enjoying less revenue than
most of the Seigneurs who were his vassals, he was to be seen
every winter sunning himself in the midst of his subjects, who
idolised him.”</p>

<p class="p1">Réné, Duke of Anjou and Maine, was prisoner to the
Duke of Burgundy, when news reached him that the inheritances
of his brother and of Queen Joanna II. of the
Two Sicilies, had fallen to him. Married to Isabella,
daughter of Charles of Lorraine, he had claimed that
duchy on the death of his father-in-law, and in opposition
to Anthony, Count of Vaudemont, nephew of
Charles. The Count of Vaudemont was supported by
Philip, Duke of Burgundy. Réné was defeated and
taken prisoner, along with his son and all his great
nobles. Conducted to the castle of Blacon, near Salines,
he was there retained in captivity till he could pay an
enormous ransom. It was, accordingly, whilst a prisoner
that he heard the news of the death of his brother,
Louis III., and of his adoption by the queen, and then
of the death of Joanna, in 1435.</p>

<p>As he was unable to take possession of his kingdom
of the Two Sicilies, he was obliged to transfer his authority
to his wife, the Duchess Isabella, a woman of rare
prudence and of masculine courage. The absence of
Réné from his kingdom of Naples gave rise to the formation
of factions: one favoured Alphonso of Aragon, a
claimant; another took the side of Pope Eugenius IV.,
who wanted to annex the Sicilies to the papal states;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a third party favoured Réné, and this latter was the most
numerous. But the King of Aragon was prompt and
determined. Alphonso hastened to Naples, took Capua,
and laid siege to Gaeta. Happily for Réné’s party,
the Genoese, who were jealous of Alphonso, forced him
to raise the siege, and took him prisoner. Later, however,
Gaeta fell before Peter, the brother of Alphonso.</p>

<p>At this time Isabella was making preparations at Aix
and in the port of Marseilles for a descent on Naples.
The Pope was induced to withdraw his claim, to lend
her 4,000 horsemen, and to help her by hurling excommunications
against the Aragonese. Meanwhile, King
Réné, by promises, had succeeded in effecting his release,
but on very harsh terms. He bound himself to
pay 200,000 gold florins, and to cede several fortified
places till his ransom was paid. His son, the Duke of
Calabria, had been set at liberty the year before for a
ransom of 25,000 florins. Réné had spent six years in
prison.</p>

<p>Delivered from his long captivity, Réné hastened to
Provence, where the estates found him 100,000 gold
florins for the prosecution of the war. In April, 1438,
Réné sailed from Marseilles for Naples. Unfortunately
for him, at this time his trusted constable, Jacopo
Caldora, died, and the king gave his place to the son
of Caldora, a man of very different stamp, who sold
himself to the King of Aragon and threw every possible
hindrance in the way of Réné, who was besieged
in Naples, and sorely hampered by lack of money
wherewith to content his soldiery. One day, as he was
passing through the streets, a widow cried to him to give
her bread for her starving children. Réné passed without
a word. “If he will not feed them, I know who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
will,” said the woman, and she hastened to betray to a
partisan of Alphonso the secret of a subterranean passage
into the town; in fact, the old aqueduct through
which, nine centuries before, Belisarius had penetrated
into Naples. The Spaniards poured into the town, and
Réné had but just time to escape to a vessel in the bay.
He retired to Provence, and there his wife, Isabella,
died in 1453. He had her body moved to Angers, and
erected over her a noble tomb, near one he had set up
some years before to his old nurse. Réné fought against
the English beside the French King, and was in the
battle of Crecy. In 1448 his daughter Margaret had
been married to Henry VI.</p>

<p>Shakespeare and the chroniclers have combined to
blacken the character of this unfortunate woman. She
is represented in repulsive colours, as unfeminine, revengeful,
loose in her morals; and even her energy
and fortitude are distorted into unnatural ferocity and
obduracy. But we cannot trust the picture painted of
her. The English people resented the marriage with an
impecunious woman, and the cession of the duchy of
Maine to the French as the price for her hand. They
were galled and writhing at the humiliation of the
English arms, in a series of victories won by the aid of
the Maid of Orleans. She was, moreover, placed in the
unnatural position of having to supply, by her force of
character, the feebleness of her husband’s rule. The
soft, feminine nature of Henry’s disposition threw hers by
contrast into undue prominence. She had penetration
to discover, what was hidden from Henry’s eyes, that
the throne was surrounded by false friends and secret
enemies. Considering the incapacity of the King, it is
unjust to judge her harshly, if she strove with all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
powers to save the crown imperilled by his feebleness.
The situation in which she was placed compelled her to
do that which is the worst thing a woman can do, to
unsex herself, and that, not like the Maid of Orleans, in
consequence of a Divine impulse, but from motives of
policy. Inevitably much has been attributed to her for
which she was not rightfully responsible. It could
hardly be otherwise than that much in her way of life
was inconsistent with her female character; a woman
cannot play a man’s part in the work of the world
without detriment to her own nature; but this was
forced on her by the helpless imbecility of her husband,
and she was compelled by the stress of circumstances
to take the first part in a struggle to save the crown, and
to hand it on to her son.</p>

<p>After the death of Isabella, Réné married Jeanne de
Laval, with whom he lived happily. He loved to walk
about the country in a broad-brimmed straw hat, and
to chat with the peasants; or else to amuse himself with
illuminating MSS. and composing poems.</p>

<p>Louis XI. was his nephew, a crafty and cold-blooded
king, and he took advantage of the inability of Réné to
offer effective resistance to dispossess him of his duchy
of Anjou. Thenceforth Réné, who had spent his time
between Anjou and Provence, was constrained to reside
only in the latter.</p>

<p>One great source of delight to him consisted in
scheming showy public processions and tournaments,
and in hunting up relics of saints. He instituted a
festival at Aix to represent the triumph of Christianity
over Paganism, that was to be repeated annually. At
the head of the procession appeared the gods, with their
proper attributes&mdash;Jove with his eagle and thunderbolts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Pluto surrounded by devils, Diana with her crescent,
Venus in the scantiest of garments. Around their
chariot trotted an assembly of lepers covered with sores
and vested in rags. Then came a body of pipers,
dancers, and soldiers. Next appeared the Queen of
Sheba on a visit to Solomon; Moses with the Tables
of the Law, and with gilt horns; round him a rabble
of Jews hooting and cutting derisive antics, and
dancing about a golden calf. Next came apostles and
evangelists, all with their appropriate symbols, and
Judas, against whose head the apostles delivered
whacks, Peter with his keys, Andrew with his cross,
James with his staff.</p>

<p>Then came a gigantic figure to represent S. Christopher,
followed by military engaged in sham fight. Next the
Abbot of Youth, the Lord of Misrule, the Twelfth
Night King, and other allegorical figures preceding the
Blessed Sacrament, carried under a daïs. Finally the
procession closed with a figure of Death mowing to
right and left with his scythe. Each group of this
interminable procession executed a sort of dramatic
game designed by King Réné&mdash;the game of the stars,
of the devils, and so on; and the whole procession
moved, not only to the braying of horns, the beating of
drums, and the shrill notes of the wry-necked fife, but
also to the discordant clashing of all the church bells of
Aix.</p>

<p>It was a matter of keen competition annually to get
a part to play in the show. One man on a certain
occasion was highly wrath and offended because he was
not set down to the part of Devil. “My father was a
devil before me, my grandfather was a devil, why should
not I be one as well?” Possibly King Réné devised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
entertainment to draw people away from their celebration
of the Feast of Fools, a feast that existed in full
vigour until it was finally put down by the provincial
council of Aix in 1585, after Réné had vainly
endeavoured to get rid of it. This astounding piece
of ribaldry and profanity was everywhere, and every
effort made by the Church to be rid of it had met with
stubborn resistance from the people. In Dijon it was
abolished by the Parliament in 1552, as the ecclesiastical
authorities were powerless to end it.</p>

<p>The Feast of Fools was the carrying on of the old
pagan Saturnalia, when on December 17th for a week all
conditions were turned topsy-turvey. The slaves took
places at table and the masters served; and the streets
were full of riot and revelry. It was customary at Aix
and Arles, and in almost every great church in France,
from the New Year to the Epiphany, for the people to
proceed to the election of a Bishop of Fools. The
election took place amidst buffoonery and the most
indecent farces. The newly-elected was then made to
officiate pontifically at the high altar, whilst clerks
carried mitre and crozier, their faces daubed over with
paint or soot. Some men dressed as women, women were
disguised as men, and danced in the choir. Songs of
the grossest nature were sung; and in place of incense
old leather and all kinds of filth were burnt; sausages
and black puddings were eaten on the altar. The last
traces of these horrible profanities did not disappear till
the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But to return to King Réné. He died at the age of
seventy-two in July, 1480, and according to his will, his
nephew, Charles of Maine, took possession of the county
of Provence under the title of Charles IV. But he soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
died, and then Louis XI. annexed Provence, as he had
Anjou, to the French crown.</p>

<p>Réné had desired to be buried at Angers beside his
first wife, and Jeanne, his second, tried to carry out his
wishes; but the people of Aix would not hear of the
body being removed from their midst. The estates met,
and sent a petition to Jeanne to renounce the idea of
conveying the remains away from Provence. However,
she gained the consent of the archbishop to the
removal; but she was obliged to wait a whole year
before the suspicions and watchfulness of the people of
Aix would allow her to execute her purpose. Then she
sent a covered waggon, with intent, as she gave out, to
remove some of her goods from the castle at Aix; and
during the night the body of the old king was whisked
away; the horses started at a gallop, and the corpse
conveyed beyond the frontiers of the county before the
people were aware of the theft. A noble monument
was erected at Angers to contain the mortal remains of
Réné. Unhappily at the French Revolution this, as well
as the monument and statue of Isabella, his first wife,
and even that of his dear old nurse, were smashed to
fragments by the rabble.</p>

<p>The cathedral is an interesting church: the south aisle
constituted the Early Romanesque church. To this was
added the present nave in 1285, with apse. On the
south side of the church is a charming Early Romanesque
cloister, and on the north is a baptistry of the
sixth century, but somewhat altered in 1577, containing
eight columns of polished granite and marble proceeding
from some demolished temple. There are two
objects in the church likely more specially to attract
attention; the triptych of the Burning Bush, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
King Réné and Jeanne de Laval are represented kneeling
before the Bush that burns with fire and is not
consumed, and in which, by a curious anachronism, is
represented the Virgin and Child. This triptych was
painted, it is thought, by Van der Meire, a disciple of
Van Eyck. The other object is the magnificent series
of tapestries in the choir, representing the Life of Our
Lord, which came from S. Paul’s Cathedral, London,
whence they were ejected at the time of the Commonwealth.
The date of these tapestries is 1511, and they
are attributed to Quentin Matsys of Antwerp.</p>

<p>The museum of Aix richly deserves a visit. It contains
bas-reliefs dug up at Entremont, where was the old
Ligurian stronghold, taken by Sextius Calvinus; and
these are the very earliest bits of Gaulish sculpture that
have been found anywhere. There are also numerous
relics of the classic Aix that have been unearthed in the
town, and Christian sarcophagi sculptured with Biblical
scenes.</p>

<p>In the town library is King Réné’s <i>Book of Hours</i>,
illuminated by his own hand.</p>

<span class="mid">TOULON</span></h2>

and dockyard&mdash;Galley slaves&mdash;The Bagne&mdash;The Red Caps&mdash;Travaux

<p class="drop-cap04">THE precipices of limestone, Coudon, 1,205 feet high,
and Faron, 1,790 feet, standing as guardians over
Toulon, crowned with gleaming circles of white fortifications,
effectually protect the great arsenal and dockyards
of this place of first importance to France. Coudon
looks out over the <i>crau</i> towards the Gulf of Hyères,
and would effectually prevent attack thence; and Faron,
standing immediately above the harbour of Toulon,
could sink any fleet that ventured within range. Indeed,
till these two fortresses should be silenced, Toulon
would be impregnable.</p>

<p>Faron (<i>Pharus</i>), as its name implies, was formerly the
beacon height to the <i>Rade</i>. During the night a fire
was flaming on its summit, during the day moistened
straw was burnt to send up a column of smoke. This
language of signals communicated to the population of
the coast the appearance on the horizon of vessels suspected
of piratical intent. The beacon of Faron communicated
with other beacons on heights within sight of
one another. The keeping up of these signals on points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of observation was essential to the protection of the
coast, and the archives of Toulon contain a series of
agreements concluded between the town and the neighbouring
places, for the maintenance of the watch-tower
of Faron, as also that of Six Fours, one of the most
ancient lighthouses of France.</p>

<p>Toulon, the Latin Telo Martius, was originally a
Phœnician settlement for the preparation of the famous
Tyrian dye, made out of the shell of the <i>murex</i>. The
Latins called it the Telo of Mars, the God of War,
because, as lover of blood, he was patron as well of the
dye, which ranged through all the gamut of tints from
crimson to blue-purple.</p>

<p>The town was ravaged successively by Franks and
Saracens, and sank to insignificance; it did not become
a place of maritime and military importance till the
sixteenth century, when Henry IV. built the forts of
Ste. Catherine and S. Antoine, and the two great moles
that flank the port; he was the first to discern that the
pivot of defence of Provence lay here. Louis XIV.
confided to Colbert the reorganisation of the fleet; and
for the purpose dockyards, workshops of all descriptions,
were needed. The basins were enlarged and deepened,
and Vauban received instructions to extend the quays,
construct fortifications, surround the city with a series
of star forts, according to the system that has immortalised
his name, and, in a word, make of Toulon the first
arsenal of France. It was due to this that the place was
able to withstand the sieges of 1707 and 1793. Toulon
was, moreover, made the largest convict establishment of
France; and the convicts were employed on the work
of its defences, in excavating basins, and building quays
and warehouses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In ancient times&mdash;indeed, from the classic period&mdash;the
arduous and exhausting work of rowing vessels was
given to slaves and prisoners. No free man would
endure the toil and hardship of the galleys. War
vessels, merchantmen, and pleasure yachts were alike
propelled by this unfortunate class of men. Jacques
Cœur, the banker, had four coquettish galleys with
gilded prows and oars, propelled by prisoners hired for
his service. Each of these vessels had at the bows a
sacred image, wreathed with flowers, of the saint whose
name it bore. There was La Madeleine, S. Jacques,
S. Michel, and S. Denis. Charles VII. seized them all;
he did not leave a single boat to the fugitive merchant,
whose only fault was that he had made the King of
France his debtor to the amount of a hundred thousand
crowns.</p>

<p>In a large galley as many as six men were required
for each oar. Sweating close together, for hour after
hour, not sitting, but leaping on the bench, in order to
throw their whole weight on the oar, they were kept to
their task with little relaxation.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Think of six men, chained to a bench, naked as when they
were born; one foot on the stretcher, and the other on the
bench in front, holding an immensely heavy oar (15 feet long),
bending forward to the stern with arms at full reach to clear
the backs of the rowers in front, who bend likewise; and then,
having got forward, shoving up the oar’s end, to let the blade
catch the water, then throwing their bodies back on to the
groaning bench. A galley was thus propelled sometimes for
ten, twelve, or even twenty hours, without a moment’s rest.
The boatswain in such a stress puts a piece of bread steeped
in wine into the wretched rower’s mouth to stop fainting, and
then the captain shouts the order to redouble the lash. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a slave falls exhausted upon his oar (which often happens),
he is flogged till he is taken for dead, and then pitched unceremoniously
into the sea.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Jean Marteille, of Bergerac, who was himself on the
galleys about the year 1701, thus described the life:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Those who have not seen a galley at sea, especially in
chasing or being chased, cannot well conceive the shock such
a spectacle must give to a heart capable of the least tincture
of compassion. To behold ranks and files of half naked, half
starved, half tanned, meagre wretches, chained to a plank,
from which they do not remove for months together (commonly
half a year), urged on even beyond human endurance, with
cruel and repeated blows on their bare flesh, to the incessant
toil at the most laborious of all exercises, which often happens
in a furious chase,&mdash;was indeed a horrifying spectacle.”</p>

<p class="p1">To be condemned to the galleys was not necessarily a
life sentence. At first all such as were sent thither
were branded on the shoulder with GAL, but afterwards
this was changed to T.F. for Travaux forcés,
or T.P. if for life; and each class wore a special
coloured cap. Great was the indignation felt at the
Revolution, on ascertaining that the red cap of Liberty
was what was worn by one class of gaol-birds. A
member of the Convention rose and demanded that this
honourable badge should be removed from their heads;
and amidst thunders of applause, the motion was carried.
A special commissioner was despatched to Toulon to
order the abolition of the red cap from the Bagne.
Accordingly all the caps were confiscated and burnt.
But the National Convention had made no provision
for replacing the red cap with one of another colour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
consequently the prisoners had for some time to go
bare-headed. In 1544 the Archbishop of Bourges
sent a couple of priests and two other clerks to the
captain of the galleys at Toulon, and required him to
put them to hard labour. But this was regarded by the
Parliament as an infringement of its rights, and the
captain was ordered to send the clerics back to
the archbishop.</p>

<p>Men were condemned to the galleys for every sort
of crime and fault. Many a wretched Huguenot toiled
at the oar. Often enough a nobleman laboured beside a
man belonging to the dregs of the people. Haudriquer
de Blancourt, in love with a lady of good rank, to flatter
her made a false entry in her pedigree, so as to
enhance her nobility. There ensued an outcry among
heralds, and for this De Blancourt was sent to the
galleys.</p>

<p>As naval construction and science improved, oars
were no longer employed, and sails took their places;
the galleys were moored at Toulon, Brest and Roquefort,
and acquired the name of Bagnes. The derivation
is uncertain. By some it is supposed to be derived
from the Provençal <i>bagna</i>, which signifies “moored,”
by others from the prisons of the slaves near the Bagno,
or baths of the seraglio at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Louis XVI. abolished torture, which had filled the
Bagne with cripples. Thenceforth the Bagne ceased
to be an infirmary of martyrs, and became a workshop
of vigorous labourers. The Revolution of 1789
tore up all the old codes, but it maintained the galleys,
only it changed the name of Galerien to Travaux
forcés à temps, ou à perpetuité. No one formerly
seemed to be sensible to the horrible brutality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
galleys. When Madame de Grignan wrote an account
of a visit to one of them to her friend Mme de Sévigné,
that lady replied “she would much like to see this sort
of Hell,” with “the men groaning day and night under
the weight of their chains.”</p>

<p>Furthenbach, in his <i>Architectura navalis</i> (Ulm, 1629),
says that the convict in a galley received 28 ounces of
biscuit per week, and a spoonful of a mess of rice and
vegetables. The full complement of a large galley
consisted of 270 rowers, with captain, chaplain, doctor,
boatswain, master, and ten to fifteen gentlemen
adventurers, friends of the captain, sharing his mess,
and berthed in the poop; also about eighteen marines
and ten warders, a carpenter, cook, cooper, and smith,
&amp;c., and from fifty to sixty soldiers; so that the whole
equipage of a galley must have reached a total of four
hundred men.</p>

<p>The Bagne has seen strange inmates. Perhaps no
story of a <i>forçat</i> is more extraordinary than that of
Cognard, better known as the Count of Pontis de
Sainte-Hélène. This man, who seemed to have been
born to command, was well built, tall, and singularly
handsome, with a keen eye and a lofty carriage. This
fellow managed to escape from the Bagne, and made
his way into Spain, where he formed an acquaintance
with the noble family of Pontis de Sainte-Hélène, and
by some means, never fully cleared up, blotted the
whole family out of life and secured all their papers,
and thenceforth passed himself off as a Pontis. Under
this name he became a sub-lieutenant in the Spanish
army, then rose to be captain of a squadron, and after
the attack on Montevideo, gained the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
Later he formed a foreign legion, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
part in the political struggles in the Peninsula. He
affected the most rigid probity in all matters of military
accounts, and denounced two of the officers who had
been guilty of embezzlement. But these men, in their
own defence, accused Pontis of malversion, and General
Wimpfen had him arrested. He escaped, but was
caught, and transferred to Palma, among the French
prisoners. In the bay was lying a Spanish brig.
Cognard proposed to his fellow prisoners to attempt
to capture it. The <i>coup de main</i> succeeded, and after
having taken the brig, they sailed for Algiers, where
they sold the vessel, and went to Malaga, then in
French occupation. Count Pontis was given a squadron
under the Duke of Dalmatia; and when the French
army retreated he was accorded a battalion in the
100th regiment of the line.</p>

<p>At the siege of Toulouse, the Count of Pontis, at the
head of a flying column, took an English battery. At
Waterloo he was wounded.</p>

<p>In 1815 the Count was made Knight of Saint Louis,
and given a battalion in the legion of the Seine, and
in six months was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel.
One day the Duc de Berri asked him if he were one of
the noble Spanish House of Ste. Hélène. “Pardieu, mon
prince,” answered Cognard, “je suis noble, et de la vieille
roche encore.”</p>

<p>Cognard, covered with decorations, in his rich
uniform, at the head of his regiment, at reviews&mdash;might
well have pushed his fortune further, but for
an unfortunate meeting. One day, as commander of
his corps, he presided, near the column of the Place
Vendôme, at a military degradation; when an old Toulon
convict, who had been released, observed him, eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
him attentively, and, convinced that he recognised an
old comrade of the Bagne, in a fit of spleen and envy,
denounced him as such.</p>

<p>The general Despinois sent for Pontis, and finding
that there was much that was equivocal on his part, despatched
him, under the charge of four gens d’armes,
to the Abbaye. There he obtained from the officer permission
to change his linen, was allowed to return to his
quarters, possessed himself of a pair of pistols, and
escaped. Six months after, the Count Pontis de Sainte
Hélène, lieutenant-colonel of the legion of the Seine,
Knight of S. Louis and of the legion of honour, was
recaptured, convicted of appearing under a false name,
suspected of the murder of the Pontis family, recognised
as an evaded convict, and was sent to end his days in
the Bagne at Brest.</p>

<p>In October, 1793, a disorderly mob of soldiers and
revolutionary cut-throats, under the command of the
painter Carteaux, after having dyed their hands in the
blood of six thousand of their countrymen, whom they
had massacred at Lyons, invested Toulon, which had
shut its gates against the revolutionary army, and had
thrown open its port to the English. The town was
crowded with refugees from Marseilles, and its bastions
were occupied by a mixed multitude of defenders,
Sardinians, Spaniards, French, and English, united in
nothing save in common hatred of the monsters who
were embrued in blood.</p>

<p>The investing army was divided into two corps,
separated by the Faron. On the west was Ollioules,
where Carteaux had established his headquarters. The
commander-in-chief, ignorant of the first principles of
military science, and allowing his wife to draw out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
orders for the day, and sign them as Femme Carteaux,
had planted his batteries where they could do no injury
to the English fleet. The siege had begun in September;
it dragged on through October. There was organisation
neither in the host nor in the commissariat. The army
was composed partly of troops detached from that of
Italy, mainly of volunteers set at liberty by the taking
of Lyons, and a horde of Marseillais ruffians, animated
by hopes of murder and plunder.</p>

<p>In the midst of this confusion Bonaparte arrived
before Toulon, and appearing before Carteaux had the
audacity to point out to him the rudimentary errors he
had committed. Carteaux was furious, but his claws
were clipped by the Commissioners, who, satisfied of
his incompetence, dismissed him, and Dugommier, an
old officer, was placed in command. On November 25th
a council of war was held, and the Commissioners placed
the command of the artillery in the hands of Bonaparte.</p>

<p>In compliance with his instructions, the whole force
of the besiegers was directed against the English redoubt
Mulgrave, now fort Caire, on the Aiguillette.
An attempt to carry it by assault was made on the
morning of December 17th. The troops of the Convention
were driven back, and Dugommier, who headed the
attempt, gave up all for lost. But fresh troops were
rapidly brought up in support, another onslaught was
attempted, and succeeded in overpowering the Spanish
soldiers, to whom a portion of the line was entrusted;
whereupon the assailants broke in, turned the flank of
the English detachment, and cut down three hundred
of them.</p>

<p>The possession of this fort rendered the further maintenance
of the exterior defences of Toulon impracticable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Its effect was at once recognised by the English
commander, and during the night the whole of the allied
troops were withdrawn from the promontory into the
city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another attack had been made, under the
direction of Napoleon, on the rocky heights of Faron,
which were carried, and the mountain was occupied by
the Republicans, who hoisted the tricolor flag.</p>

<p>The garrison of Toulon consisted of above ten thousand
men, and the fortifications of the town itself were as yet
uninjured; but the harbour was commanded and swept
by the guns of the enemy from l’Aiguillette and Faron.
Sir Samuel Hood, in command of the English squadron,
strongly urged the necessity of recovering the points
that had been lost; but he was overruled, and it was resolved
to evacuate the place.</p>

<p>When the citizens of Toulon became aware of this
decision, they were filled with dismay. They knew but
too well what fate was in store for them if left to the
hands of their remorseless fellow-countrymen. Accordingly
the quays were crowded with terror-stricken men
and women imploring to be taken on board, whilst
already the shot from Napoleon’s batteries tore lanes
among them, or his shells exploded in their midst.
With difficulty, as many as could be accommodated
were placed in boats and conveyed to the ships. Fourteen
thousand were thus rescued; but Napoleon directed
shot and shell among the boats, sinking some, and
drowning the unhappy and innocent persons who were
flying from their homes.</p>

<p>The prisoners now broke their chains and added to
the horror, as they burst into the deserted houses, robbing
and firing and murdering where resistance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
offered. Next day the troops of the Convention entered
the town. During the ensuing days, some hundreds of
the inhabitants who had not escaped were swept together
into an open place, and without any form of trial were
shot.</p>

<p>Barras and Fréron issued a proclamation that all who
considered themselves to be good citizens were required
to assemble in the Champ-de-Mars under pain of death.
Three thousand responded to the order. Fréron was
on horseback, surrounded by the troops, cannon, and
Jacobins. Turning to these latter, he said, “Go into
the crowd and pick out whom you will, and range them
along that wall.”</p>

<p>The Jacobins went in and did as desired, according
to their caprice. Then, at a signal from Fréron, the
guns were discharged, and the unhappy crowd swayed;
some fell, others, against the wall, dropped. Fréron
shouted, “Let those who are not dead stand up.” Such
as had been wounded only rose, when another volley
sent them out of life.</p>

<p>Salicetti wrote exultingly: “The town is on fire, and
offers a hideous spectacle; most of the inhabitants have
escaped. Those who remain will serve to appease the
manes of our brave brothers who fought with such
valor.” Fouché, Napoleon’s future Head of Police,
wrote: “Tears of joy stream over my cheeks and flood
my soul. We have but one way in which to celebrate
our victory. We have this evening sent 213 rebels
under the fire of our lightning.” “We must guillotine
others,” said Barras, “to save ourselves from being
guillotined.” Executions went on for several days, and
numbers of the hapless remnant perished. But even
this did not satisfy the Convention. On the motion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Barrère, it was decreed that the name of Toulon should
be blotted out, and a commission, consisting of Barras,
Fréron, and the younger Robespierre, was ordered to
continue the slaughter. Such as were able bought their
lives. One old merchant of eighty-four offered all his
wealth save eight hundred livres; but the revolutionary
judge, coveting the whole, sent him under the guillotine,
and confiscated his entire property.</p>

<p>Whilst the butchery was in progress, a grand dinner
was given in celebration of the taking of the town.
Generals, representatives of the people, sans-culottes,
galley-slaves, “the only respectable persons in the
town,” as the commissioners said, sat down together,
the commissioners occupying a separate table.</p>

<p>Toulon again gradually refilled with people, and under
the Directory it was constituted the first military port
of France. From Toulon Bonaparte organised his expedition
to Egypt.</p>

Ile du Levant&mdash;Mutiny&mdash;Horrible scenes&mdash;Sentences.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT will be at Hyères, probably, that the visitor to the
Riviera first realises that he has come amidst tropical
vegetation, for here he will first see palms, agaves,
and aloes in full luxuriance. Moreover, the olive, which
has been seen, but not in its full luxuriance, reaches its
finest development on the red soil north of the branch
line, where it parts from the main line at La Pauline.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">OLIVE TREES</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The olive is without question the most important tree
on this coast; it prevails, and gives its colour to the
country everywhere, except in the Montagnes des Maures
and the Estérel. This is a most difficult tree for an artist
to deal with, as it forms no masses of foliage; the small
pointed leaves, dull green above, pale below, are so disposed
that the foliage can be represented only by a
series of pencil scratches. The trunk has a tendency to
split into three or four parts in the ground. The vitality
of the olive is remarkable. After a century, it may be
after more, the core of the trunk decays, and the tree
parts into sections, and lives on through the ever-vital
bark. The bark curls about the decayed sections, and
forms a fresh tree. Consequently, in place of one huge
ancient olive, one finds three or four younger trees, but all
with a look on them as if they were the children of old
age, growing out of the same root. And when this
second generation dies, the vitality of the root remains
unimpaired; it throws up new shoots, and thus the life
of the tree, like that of an ancient family, is indefinitely
prolonged. The healthy olive tree, well fed on old rags
and filth of every description, to which it is exceedingly
partial, is very beautiful; but the beauty of the olive
tree comes out in winter and early spring; when the
deciduous trees are in leaf and brilliant green, it looks
dull and dowdy. The olive flowers from April to June,
and the fruit requires about six months to reach maturity.
The harvest, accordingly, is in winter. The berry
becomes black finally, and falls from the tree in December
and January. The oil from the fully matured olives
is more abundant, but is not so good in quality as that
expressed from the berry whilst still green. The olives,
when gathered, are taken to the mills, which are rude,
picturesque buildings, planted in the ravines to command
water power; but occasionally the crushing is done by
horses turning the mills. The olives are crushed by
stone rollers; the pulp is put into baskets and saturated
with hot water, and subjected to great pressure. The
juice then squeezed out is carried into vats, where the
oil floats on the surface and is skimmed off.</p>

<p>The wood of the olive is used for fuel, and for boxes
and other ornaments that are hand-painted.</p>

<p>The tree requires good nourishment if it is to be well
cropped, and it is most partial to a dressing of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
rotten rags. All the filthy and decayed scraps of
clothing cast by the Neapolitan peasantry are carried
in boats to the coast and are eagerly bought as manure.</p>

<p>At Hyères, moreover, we come on the orange and the
lemon. The orange was originally imported from China
into Spain, and thence passed to Italy and the Riviera.
Oranges are said to live four or five hundred years.
S. Dominic planted one in the garden at Sta. Sabina, at
Rome, in 1200, that still flourishes. Hale and fruit-bearing
also is that at Fondi, planted by Thomas
Aquinas in 1278. Nevertheless, it is certain that old
orange-trees have disappeared from Hyères. Whether
they were killed by the severe winter of 1864, or whether
by a disease, is doubtful. The trees one sees now are
none of them ancient, and do not attain a height above
nine feet. The name orange comes from the Sanskrit,
and the Portuguese, who introduced the orange to
Europe, borrowed the name from the Hindus. In 1516
Francis I. was present during a naval sham fight at Marseilles,
where oranges were used as projectiles. Oranges
had been grown sufficiently long at Hyères to have
attained a great size in the sixteenth century, for when
there, Charles IX., his brother the Duke of Anjou, and
the King of Navarre, by stretching their hands, together
hooped round the trunk of one tree that bore 14,000
oranges. Thereupon was cut in the bark, “<i>Caroli regis
amplexu glorior</i>.” But there are no such orange-trees as
that now at Hyères. Probably that was of a more hardy
nature and of inferior quality to the orange-tree now
grown. In fact, the present strain of oranges cultivated
is a late importation, not earlier than about 1848. When
a horticulturist of Marseilles imported it, it was next
brought to Bordighera; from thence it passed to San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Remo, to Ventimiglia, and thence to Nice. The orange,
and above all the lemon, is very sensitive to cold, and
the frost of February, 1905, blighted nearly every tree
along the coast, turning the leaves a pale straw colour.
Only in very sheltered spots did they retain their green
and gloss.</p>

<p>About Solliés-Pont the sumac is grown for the sake
of its tannin. The leaves only are used, but for them
the branches are cut off. When these are dry they are
stripped of their foliage by women and children. The
leaves are then pounded to powder, and are packed in
sacks and sent away. Thirty per cent. of the matter in
the dried sumac leaves is tannin.</p>

<p>At Hyères we have passed abruptly from the limestone
to the schist that has been heaved up by the
granite of the Montagnes des Maures. The Gapeau,
which at present flows into the sea to the east of Hyères,
originally discharged past La Garde into the Rade de
Toulon. But it brought down such a quantity of rubble
from the limestone range&mdash;of which the Pilon de la
Sainte Beaume is the highest point&mdash;that it has formed
a <i>crau</i> of its own, and choked up its mouth to such
an extent as to force its current to turn to the farther
side of the Maurettes so as to find a passage to the sea.</p>

<p>Hyères is a notable place for the abrupt contrast it
exhibits between what is ancient and what is modern.
Down the slope of the height, that is crowned by the
castle, slides the old town, with narrow streets, mere
lanes, to its old walls, in which are gateways, and through
these arches we emerge at once into everything that is
most up-to-date. At a stride we pass out of the Middle
Ages into modern times. There is no intervening zone
of transition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>At Hyères the Maurette rises as a natural screen, facing
the sun, banking out the north wind, with the <i>crau</i> of the
Gapeau on one side, and the bed of the Gapeau on the
other; and of course, those who go to the South for
shelter would naturally, one would suppose, keep
the screen between themselves and the Mistral. But
not so. Settlers have thought they had done all that was
required when they came to Hyères, and have built
their villas, and extended the town to the north-west,
precisely where there is no shelter at all, and there is full
exposure to the blasts from the north. One great disadvantage
to Hyères is the distance at which it stands
from the sea.</p>

<p>Hyères belonged originally to the family de Fos,
which had the marquisate of Marseilles, an immense
fief containing fifty towns, Marseilles, Solliés, Toulon,
Hyères, Le Ciotat, Cassis, Aubagne, etc. But in 1257 it
was ceded to Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence.</p>

<p>The importance of Hyères was due to its salt pans.
The peninsula of Giens was undoubtedly at one time an
island, one of the group that forms a chain, of which
Porquerolles and l’Ile du Levant are the principal. But
the currents round the coast threw up shingle beds and
sealed it to the coast, forming an extensive natural lake
of salt water between the two barriers, but with a gap in
that to the east through which the sea water could flow.
In this shallow lagoon salt was produced. The entrance
could be closed, and the sun dried up the water in the
basin, leaving the salt behind. At present, with our
ready communication by rail, the importance and value
of salt in ancient times can hardly be realised. In the
centre of Gaul and of France in olden days men
ravened for salt. It was to them what sweetstuff is
now to children. They would sell anything to provide
themselves with this condiment. Conceive for a moment
what our tables would be without the salt-cellar; how
flat, how insipid would be our meals.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Schweinfurt, in his <i>Travels in the Heart of
Africa</i>, describes the loathsome parasitic growths in the
intestines of the cattle due to the absence of salt. It is
a necessity for man and beast. Our storms carry some
and deposit it on the grass; but we live in an island.
What intestinal troubles must those men have endured
who were deprived of it! Well, the lagoon of Giens
furnished a large amount, and there were other salt-pans&mdash;as
there are still, on the eastern side of Hyères.
These made the town to flourish. Salt was the main
production and source of wealth.</p>

<p>Near the Château de Carqueyranne, in the lap of the
Bay of Giens, are the ruins of a Greco-Roman town,
Pomponiana. It stretched from the beach up the hill
crowned by the remnants of the Convent of S. Pierre a’
Al-Manar. The old town was explored in 1843 by
Prince Frederick, afterwards King Frederick VII. of
Denmark. He laid bare the Acropolis, baths, cisterns,
store-houses, and a mole for the protection of the
galleys that entered the harbour. Most of what was
then laid open has since been covered over, but the
whole ground is so strewn with pottery that the
peasants have to clear their fields of it as an incumbrance.</p>

<p>The ruined convent above was occupied by Sisters of
the Benedictine Order. It was fortified, and exercised
feudal authority over the land around. In the event of
danger, the convent bell summoned the tenants to its
aid. But one winter night a frolicsome nun rang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bell for the fun of the thing, and when the vassals
arrived, laughed at them for allowing themselves to be
fooled from their beds. This prank cost the convent
dear, for shortly after a Moorish corsair put into the
bay, and the convent was attacked. The alarm bell
was sounded in vain; no one answered the summons,
and before morning the house was sacked, and the nuns
had been carried away, to be sold as slaves in Africa.</p>

<p>A curious condition of affairs existed at Hyères
during the troubles of the League.</p>

<p>The Count de Retz, Grand Marshal of France, was
Governor of Provence, and the Count de Carces was its
Grand Sénéchal. The jealousy of these two men gave
birth to a deplorable rivalry, which placed each at the
head of a different party. De Retz supported the
Huguenots, and the Catholic party took Carces as its
headpiece; and the factions called themselves, or were
called, Razats and Carcists long after the men whose
names they had adopted had disappeared from the
scene.</p>

<p>The rancour of each party did not abate, even when
plague devastated the province. Then confusion grew
worse confounded when the League was formed, due to
the death of the Duke of Anjou, brother of Henry III.,
which made Henry of Navarre, a Calvinist, heir to the
throne. The most extreme Carcists, alarmed at the
prospect of the succession falling to a Huguenot,
formed the plan of inviting the Duke of Savoy to take
Provence. The anarchy in the country became intolerable,
and large bodies of peasants and mechanics
armed and fell on the forces of Carcists and Razats
indifferently, routed and butchered them.</p>

<p>In 1586 the town of Hyères was staunch in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
adherence to the king, but the castle that commanded
it was occupied by the forces of the Baron de Méolhon,
who was also Governor of the Port of Marseilles, and
he was a Carcist, and inclined to favour the claims of
the Duke of Savoy. He had placed a Captain Merle
in the castle, with secret instructions to hold it for the
duke.</p>

<p>M. de la Valette was Governor of Provence, and he
saw himself obliged to make an attempt to take the
castle. A messenger between De Méolhon and the
Duke of Savoy had been taken with in his possession
treasonable correspondence, betraying the plans of the
Leaguers.</p>

<p>Hyères readily opened its gates to De la Valette, in
November, 1588, and he summoned Merle to surrender
the castle, but met with a prompt refusal. Then he
attempted to take it by escalading, but in vain. It
stood too high; its garrison were too alert. He could
not even prevent well-wishers of the Carcists from
smuggling provisions into the fortress.</p>

<p>At last, despairing of success, the Governor of Provence
withdrew; and having failed to take the castle by
force, had recourse to other means. He bought the aid
of a M. de Callas, a Leaguer, related to two of the
officers of the garrison, and induced him to enter the
fortress and bribe and cajole its defenders into surrendering.
Merle, however, was not to be seduced.
He must be got rid of by other means. A cannon was
dragged upstairs to an upper window of a house that
commanded Merle’s dining apartment. It was known
at what hour he supped, and in what part of the room
he sat. A signal was to be given by a traitor when
Merle took his place at the table, with his covers before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him. The appointed signal was made: the cannon
thundered, and a ball crashed in through the window
and knocked supper and wine bottles and everything
about in wreckage. But happily something had occurred
to the captain as he took his seat, and he had
left the room. When he returned, there was no more a
dumpling on the table, but an exploded shell.</p>

<p>De Callas was sent again into the castle to propose
terms of surrender. Merle would still have held out,
but the garrison had been bought, and they refused to
continue the defence. Terms of capitulation were agreed
on, whereby Merle, for surrendering, was to be indemnified
with ten thousand crowns. This extraordinary
agreement was signed on August 31st, 1589, after the
castle had held out against the king for ten months.</p>

<p>The churches of Hyères are not without interest.
That of S. Paul, on the height, has immense substructures.
It is a curious jumble of parts and styles. It
dates back to the eleventh or twelfth century, but the
vaulting is later, and later windows were added. The
great square tower is Romanesque.</p>

<p>The other church, outside the walls, that of S. Louis,
is in much better preservation. It was the chapel of the
Knights of the Temple, and is of the twelfth century,
very severe, without sculptured capitals to the pillars,
and without clerestory. It is a somewhat gloomy
church, deriving nearly all its light from the west
window. The preceptory of the Templars is within
the old town, and is now the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p>The Iles de Hyères are a detached portion of the
crystalline rocks of the Montagnes des Maures. Their
climatic condition is very different from that of Hyères,
as they are exposed to the sweep of every wind. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
are bleak and uninviting. The only inhabitants are
fishermen, Customs-officers, and the lighthouse men.</p>

<p>On L’Ile du Levant was a reformatory for young
criminals, started by M. de Pourtalès, but it came to
a disastrous end.</p>

<p>According to a law of 1850, such reformatories might
be founded and conducted by private individuals, and
in 1860 the Count de Pourtalès, as an act of humanity,
established an agricultural colony on this island for
young criminals, and placed over it an amiable, well-intentioned
man named Fauvau.</p>

<p>In Corsica was another, but that was a State establishment.
It had become a nest of such disorder and misconduct
that it was broken up in 1866, and some of the
young criminals from this Corsican reformatory were
drafted into that on the Ile du Levant, to the number
of sixty-five. These young fellows began at once to
give trouble; they complained of their food, of their
work, and they demanded meat at every meal, tobacco,
coffee, and daily six hours in which to amuse themselves.
On Tuesday, October 2nd, they broke out in
mutiny, smashed the windows and the lamps, destroyed
some of the cells, and drove away the warders. The
leader in the movement was one Coudurier, a boy of
sixteen. By his command the whole body now rushed
to the lock-up, where were confined some of those who
had misconducted themselves, broke it open, and led
them forth. Then they descended to the cellar, and
with axes and crowbars burst open the door, tapped the
barrels of wine, and drank as much as they liked.</p>

<p>Coudurier now ordered the breaking into of the store-house.
This was a building standing by itself; it had
a strong door, and windows firmly barred with iron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The young ruffians succeeded in beating in the upper
panels, but those below resisted all their efforts. They
climbed over the solid portion and carried forth bacon,
sausages, sugar, brandy, and what they could lay their
hands on, and when well laden returned over the door to
make way for others. Meantime Coudurier had chosen
two lieutenants, Ferrendon and Allard, and, in council
with them and some others of the worst miscreants, had
resolved on putting to death several of their comrades
whom they regarded as milksops and spies. By
Coudurier’s orders only those were allowed to enter the
store-house whose names he called forth, and thus he
sent fourteen of the lads he regarded as sneaks into the
magazine. Then he emptied a bottle of petroleum over
some paper by the door, and stationed Ferrendon and
Allard to prevent the egress of the lads who had been
sent in. Ferrendon by his orders set the petroleum
on fire, and he provided Allard with a long knife
with which to drive back the victims into the fire
when endeavouring to escape, and to prevent any attempt
at rescue. “Ferrendon,” said he to a comrade,
Lecocq, “is game for any mischief; and Allard is half-drunk.”
In a few minutes the sole entrance to the store-house
was a sheet of flame. One boy, Garibaldi, who
was within, at once dashed through the fire and began to
scramble over the broken door.</p>

<p>Allard stabbed him in the shoulder and breast, and
then flung him down into the sheet of flaming petroleum.
The scene now became inexpressibly horrible. The
boys, seeing the fire rapidly spreading, got to the
windows, put their arms between the bars, and screamed
for help. They pulled at the gratings with desperation,
but were unable to dislodge it. Two boys who ran forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to attempt to extinguish the fire were driven back by
the knife of Ferrendon. Some of the young criminals did
feel qualms, and a desire to free their comrades, but
were overawed by Coudurier. The lighthouse man, who
had come to the spot, got a blanket, dipped it in water
and ran to the door, but was seized by the boys, taken
off his legs, and flung into a pit twenty feet deep, and
broke his ankle in the fall, so that he was unable to stir.
A boy who snatched at the blanket and tried to extend
it to some of those in a window, was also flung into the
pit; but he happily came off better, and ran away. The
poor wretches within, black against a background of
fire, shrieked and wept; their clothes, their hair, caught
fire, and one by one they fell back into the flames behind.
The frightful end of their comrades sobered the drunken,
mutinous crew; and some strove to drown their fears
for the consequences by drinking themselves into total
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Next day the mutineers scattered over the island,
doing what mischief they pleased. Not till October 4th
did help arrive, when the fire was extinguished, the
island was occupied by soldiery, and the youths were
taken to prison on the mainland, and the ringleaders
brought to trial.</p>

<p>It may be wondered where was Fauvau, the Director,
all this while. He and the chaplain had got into a boat
and escaped to shore. What had become of the warders
we are not told, but they seem also to have effected
their escape.</p>

<p>On January 3rd, 1867, sixteen of the young criminals
were tried at Draguignan. Ferrendon was a boy little
over thirteen, a lad with a soft expressive face. Allard
was aged thirteen, with a hangdog, evil look. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
accused was a lad from Paris, refined in appearance and
with large, beautiful eyes. One was aged twenty.
Coudurier, Fouché, Laurent, and Bérond were found
guilty by the jury, not of murder, but of homicide, with
extenuating circumstances, and were sentenced to life-long
hard labour. Allard was condemned to be sent to
a reformatory for ten years. Ferrendon was discharged
as innocent! Guenau was also declared innocent.
“Where, then, am I to sleep to-night?” he asked; whereupon
the audience made up a handsome sum for him.</p>

<p>This was not the end of the matter. In prison one
of these culprits murdered another of his fellow boy-convicts
because he thought the latter had given evidence
against him. It is hard to say which came out
worst in this affair, the Director, Chaplain, and warders,
or the jury at Draguignan.</p>

<p>Although M. de Pourtalès was willing to renew the
experiment, the establishment was not restored, and of
the reformatory only the ruins remain.</p>

<span class="mid">LES MONTAGNES DES MAURES</span></h2>

<p class="pch">Exceptional character of the Maures&mdash;Warm quarters in the Southern
nooks of the chain&mdash;A future for them&mdash;The cork tree&mdash;The carob&mdash;The
mulberry&mdash;The Saracens take possession of the chain&mdash;King
Hugh makes terms with them: his history&mdash;Marozia&mdash;S. Majolus&mdash;William
of Provence&mdash;Le Grand Fraxinet&mdash;Grimaud&mdash;S. Tropez&mdash;The
Bravade.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">A HUNCH of granite heaved up, and carrying on
its back the beds of schist and gneiss that had
overlain it, stands up between the Gapeau and the
Argens. Its nearest geological relations, not connexions,
are the Cevennes and Corsica, all pertaining to the
same period of upheaval. Only to the east does the
granite assert itself above the overlying formations.
This mass of mountain is of no great elevation, never
rising above 1,200 feet, and extending over a superficies
of 200,000 acres.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It forms by itself,” says Elisée Reclus, “an orographic system
sharply limited. Its mass of granite, gneiss, and schist is
separated from the surrounding limestone mountains by profound
and wide valleys, those of the Aille, the Argens, and the
Gapeau. In fact, it constitutes an <i>ensemble</i> as distinct from
the rest of Provence as if it were an island separated from the
continent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The forms of the mountains are rounded, and there
are no bold crags; but it is scooped out into valleys that
descend rapidly to the sea and to little bays; and these
scoopings afford shelter from winter winds and cold,
facing the sun, and walled in from every blast.</p>

<p>I know a farm kitchen where a pair of curved settees
are drawn about the fire, and the gap between the
settees is closed in the evening by a green baize curtain.
The family sits on a winter night in this cosy enclosure,
the men with their pipes and jugs of cider, the women
knitting and sewing; all chattering, singing, laughing.</p>

<p>Now the southern face of the Maures is precisely
such a snuggery formed by Nature. The mountains
curve about to focus the sun’s rays; and the cork woods,
evergreen, kill all glare. Here the date trees ripen their
fruit; here the icy blasts do not shrivel up the eucalyptus,
and smite down the oranges.</p>

<p>The pity is, there are as yet no well-established winter
resorts at Lavandou, Cavalière, and, above all, Cavalaire&mdash;places
more adapted to delicate lungs than Hyères,
exposed to the currents of wind over the Crau; than
that blow-hole S. Raphael, planted between the cheeks
of the Maures and l’Estérel; than Cannes, where the
winds come down from the snows over the plains of the
Siagne; than Nice, with the Paillon on one side and the
Var on the other.</p>

<p>But for the English visitor in these suntraps three
things are lacking&mdash;a lawn-tennis ground, a lending
library, and an English chapel. Inevitably the Bay of
Cavalaire will, in the future, become a great refuge for
invalids. But that this may become so, above all, what
is needed is a bunch of thorns applied to the tail of the
engine that runs the train along the line from Hyères<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to S. Raphael by the coast. From Hyères to that place
is just fifty miles, and the quick trains do it in four, the
slow in five hours.</p>

<p>The mountains are mantled in cork wood, save the
bald heads of some, and the making of corks is the
main industry of the scattered villages.</p>

<p>The cork tree (<i>Quercus suber</i>) retains its leaves for
two years. It has two envelopes of bark, which are
quite distinct. The inner cannot be removed without
destroying the life of the tree.</p>

<p>Virgin cork is not of much value; it is employed only
for nets, and has no elasticity.</p>

<p>Only after the third harvest is the cork in perfect
condition. The tree is then about forty years old. It
is first skinned (<i>démasclée</i>) when the tree is aged twenty
or five-and-twenty. The second peeling takes place
when it is aged thirty or five-and-thirty. The third
and best is collected when the tree is between forty and
forty-five years old. The cork is taken off the trunk
from above the ground to a height of about six feet,
leaving the under surface of a coffee colour.</p>

<p>The cork bark is plunged into a cauldron of boiling
water, and is left in it for half an hour. Then it is cut
into strips, next into squares. It is again boiled for
a quarter of an hour, and then allowed slowly to dry,
and is not touched again for six months, after which it
is cut into shape. The best corks are made out of
strips that have been kept for three years. To whiten
the corks they are subjected to sulphur fumes.</p>

<p>The great enemy to the cork tree is the <i>Coroebus
bifascatus</i>, an insect that bores a gallery, not in the
bark, but in the wood of the tree. It attacks the
branches, and its presence can be detected by the sickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
look of the leaves. When this indication shows that it
is burrowing, the branches affected are cut off above
the point to which it has bored, and are burnt.</p>

<p>At one time it was supposed that the cork tree required
no culture. But of late years great pains have been
taken with it, and it readily responds to them. A self-sown
tree growing up in the midst of heather and
cistus is not likely to attain to a great size. It is cut
down to the root; then, when it sends up fresh shoots,
one is kept, the rest removed. This operation has to
be repeated, and the ground about the root to be well
dressed. After six years the tree will take care of
itself.</p>

<p>The great danger, above all, to which the cork woods
are exposed, is fire; whole tracts have been devastated
in this way, and the proprietors ruined. Consequently,
precautions are insisted on. Smokers are specially
warned not to throw about their unextinguished matches.</p>

<p>The carob tree (<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i>) is another that is
met with, and which attracts the attention of the visitor
from the north. The pods, called locust beans, are
supposed to have been those on which S. John the
Baptist fed when in the wilderness. These beans grow
in shape like a horn, which has given its name to the
tree. They contain a sweet nutritious pulp, enclosing
yellow seeds. The fruit is used extensively for feeding
animals, and is eaten by children, who, indeed, will eat
anything. When the phylloxera was ravaging the vineyards
of France, a company started a distillery at Cette
to manufacture cognac out of the fruit of the carob.
But it failed, as the brandy so made retained a peculiar
and disagreeable flavour that could not be got out of it.</p>

<p>The carob is an evergreen, vigorous and beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
It grows in most stony, arid spots, where is hardly a
particle of soil. Such a tree cannot live only on what
it derives from its roots; it must live in a great measure
by its leaves, as, indeed, to a large extent, do all evergreens.
The scanty soil will in many places not feed
trees that drop their leaves in autumn, and supply them
afresh every spring. Such renewal exacts from the
poor soil more than it can furnish. Consequently,
Nature spreads evergreens over the rocky surfaces that
contain but slight nutritive elements. Thus it is that
in Provence the vegetation is nearly all of an evergreen
character.</p>

<p>Beside the manufacture of corks, the inhabitants of
the Maures breed silkworms, and so grow mulberry
trees for their sustenance.</p>

<p>King Réné is credited with having introduced the
mulberry into Provence from Sicily; but it is more
probable that it is indigenous. What Réné did was to
suggest its utilisation for the feeding of the silkworm.
This branch of production was greatly encouraged by
Henry IV., but wars and intestine troubles, the ravaging
of the country by rival factions, by the Savoyards and
by the French, caused the cultivation of the silkworm to
decline. Of late years, however, it has been on the
increase, and the number of mulberry trees planted has
accordingly also, greatly increased. The Chain des
Maures takes its name from the Saracens, who occupied
it, and made it their stronghold, whence they descended
to burn and destroy.</p>

<p>By the infusion of new elements, forms of government,
new religious ideas, conceptions of individual and
political rights, the old world of Gaul was in process of
transformation; it was gradually organising itself on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
broad basis, when in the midst of this society in reconstruction
appeared a new element, quite unknown,
and on whose advent no reckoning had been made.
It came from the coasts of Africa, and was Mohammedan.
Some called these people Hagarenes, as descendants of
Hagar, but they themselves regarded their descent as
from Sarah, and so called themselves Saracens.</p>

<p>Their first appearance on the Provençal coast was in
730, when they sacked Nice and other towns, and the
inhabitants fled to the mountains to save their lives.</p>

<p>They harassed the littoral incessantly, not in large
forces at a time, attempting a conquest, but arriving in
a few vessels, unexpectedly, to pillage, murder, and carry
away captives. As soon as ever the forces of the Counts
arrived, they escaped to their ships and fled, to recommence
their devastations at another point.</p>

<p>In 846 the Saracens carried ruin and desolation over
the whole plain of Aix, and made themselves masters
of all vantage points along the coast. The population
sunk in despair, no longer offered effective resistance,
and the nobles, quarrelling among themselves, invoked
the aid of the infidels against their neighbours of whom
they were jealous. About this time it happened that
a Moorish pirate was wrecked in the bay of S. Tropez.
He soon saw the strategic value of the chain of granite
and schist mountains, and returning to Africa collected
a large band, crossed the sea, and took possession of
the whole mountainous block. At this time, moreover,
Mussulman Spain was a prey to a bloody schism. The
dynasty of the Abassides was succeeded by that of the
Ommiades, and the vicissitudes of parties continually
augmented the number of those who were conquered
and proscribed. These, flying from Spain, sought refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in this corner of Provence, which by such means was
converted into a little Mussulman realm. On every
height was built a <i>rebath</i>, a fort that the Christians
called a <i>fraxinet</i>, whence a sharp watch was kept over
the sea, and should a merchant vessel be descried, at
once a flotilla of pirate boats started out of the harbour
of S. Tropez, and fell on the unfortunate merchantmen.</p>

<p>Thus established here, masters also of the Balearic
Isles, of Sardinia and Sicily, as well as of the African
coast, they completely paralysed the trade of the
Mediterranean, and exposed the inhabitants of the seaboard,
that was Christian, to daily peril of being carried
off to be sold in the slave markets of Tunis and
Morocco.</p>

<p>In Spain, the Mussulman conquerors had developed
a high state of civilization. They had become architects
of great skill. They cultivated science and literature.</p>

<p>In Provence they were not constructive. They did
nothing for civilization, everything to waste, set back,
and to destroy. They have left behind them in the
country not a trace, save a few names, of their strongholds.
The condition of affairs had became intolerable.
The Moors of the Grand Fraxinet, their principal
fortress in the Montagnes des Maures, started on a
pillaging expedition, crossed Lower Provence, and
entered the Alps. As they turned north they met with
great resistance. They ascended the river Roja, they
pushed over the Col de Tende, and descended into the
plains of Lombardy. They took the monastery of
S. Dalmas de Pedene, and although most of the monks
had fled, they caught and killed forty of them, and
either massacred or took prisoners all the peasants
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Another pillaging excursion crossed the great
S. Bernard to attack the monastery of S. Maurice,
where the Archbishop of Embrun, and some of the
Provençal prelates had stored the treasures of their
churches. A third party from the Fraxinet, aided by
a fleet from Africa, had taken Genoa, and put all the inhabitants
to the edge of the sword.</p>

<p>Hugh, Count of Provence and King of Italy, was
appealed to for aid. Having no naval force to oppose
to that of the Moors, he solicited help from the Emperor
of the East, and a fleet from Constantinople entered the
Gulf of S. Tropez, and burnt that of the Saracens.
Hugh, in the meantime, invaded the mountains and
reached the Fraxinet.</p>

<p>But whilst thus engaged, he heard that Berengarius,
Marquess of Ivrea, had taken advantage of his absence
to fall on his possessions in Italy. Hugh thereupon dismissed
the Greek fleet, and made an alliance with the
Saracens, to whom he committed the passages of the
Alps.</p>

<p>About this same Hugh of Provence, one of the
biggest scoundrels who ever breathed, it will be as well
to say something.</p>

<p>Hugh was the son of Theobald, Count of Provence,
and of Bertha, daughter of Lothair, King of Burgundy.
The House of Provence had acquired great possessions
during the reign of Louis III., King of Arles and
Emperor (d. 915), the uncle of Hugh. But Hugh was
not content. He raised pretensions to the kingdom of
Italy, then held by Rudolf, King of Transjuran Burgundy.
Hugh was seconded by his half-brothers Guido
and Lambert, Dukes of Tuscany and Spoleto, and by
his sister, Ermengarde, widow of the Marquess of Ivrea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Pope John X., Lambert, Archbishop of Milan, and
nearly all the Lombard nobles, supported his claim, and
he disembarked at Pisa in 926, and was crowned at
Pavia. The crafty Hugh, fully estimating the influence
of the clergy in the politics of Italy, affected the most
profound zeal for religion, and flattered the clergy.
John X., in Rome, was in a difficult position. Rome at
the time was ruled by the infamous Marozia. John had
been the favourite of Marozia’s equally infamous mother
Theodora. He had, in fact, been her paramour, and it
was she who had advanced him from one bishopric to
another, and had finally placed the tiara on his head.
On the death of his mistress, John found himself engaged
in a fierce contest for the mastery of Rome with
Marozia and her lover, or husband, the Marquess
Alberic, by whom she had a son of the same name, and
another, by Pope Sergius it was rumoured, whom she
afterwards elevated to the Papacy.</p>

<p>John managed to drive the Marquess out of Rome,
and he was assassinated in 925; whereupon Marozia
married Guido, Duke of Tuscany, half-brother of Hugh
of Provence. The Pope hoped, notwithstanding this
connexion, by offering the prize of the Imperial crown,
to secure Hugh’s protection against his domestic tyrants.
But he was disappointed. Marozia seized on the Pope,
the former lover of her mother. His brother Peter
was killed before his face, and John was thrown into
prison, where, some months after, he died, either of
anguish or, as was rumoured, smothered with a pillow.</p>

<p>Marozia did not venture at once to place her son on
the Papal throne. A Leo VI. was Pope for some
months, and a Stephen VII. for two years and one
month. The son was still a mere boy, too young for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the shameless woman to advance him to the Chair of
S. Peter. But on the death of Stephen, Marozia
again ruled alone in Rome; Guido, her husband, was
dead, and she made her son Pope under the title of
John XI.</p>

<p>But Marozia was not satisfied with having been the
wife, first of a Marquess, then of a Duke; the mistress
of Pope Sergius, the mother of Pope John XI. She
sent to offer her hand to Hugh of Provence, the new
King of Italy. Hugh was not scrupulous in his amours,
but there was an impediment in the way. She had
been the wife of his half-brother. But the youthful
Pope, the son of the wretched woman, was ready with
a dispensation, and the marriage was celebrated in
Rome.</p>

<p>Hugh set to work now to strike down, one after
another, the nobles who had supported him, and had
shaken down the throne of Rudolf, acting with unexampled
perfidy and ingratitude. He did not even
spare his half-brother, Lambert, who had succeeded
Guido in the Duchy of Tuscany, for he plucked out his
eyes.</p>

<p>His high-handed and merciless conduct alarmed those
who had not yet suffered. One day, Alberic, the son of
Marozia, was commanded by King Hugh to serve him
with water, at supper, so as to wash his hands. Performing
his office awkwardly or reluctantly, the youth
spilled the water, whereupon the King struck him in the
face. Alberic was furious; he went forth and placed
himself at the head of a conspiracy against his stepfather.
The bells of Rome rang out, the people rushed
into the streets, besieged the Castle of S. Angelo, and
took it. Hugh had to fly and form a court at Pavia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in 936 that King Hugh marched into Provence
to dislodge the Moors from the Grand Fraxinet, when
a general conspiracy broke out in Northern Italy, headed
by Berengar, Marquess of Ivrea. Hugh had despoiled
his half-brother, Lambert, of the Duchy of Tuscany,
and had given it to his own full brother Boso; but
after awhile, becoming jealous of his power, he had dispossessed
Boso. Berengar, Marquess of Ivrea, had
married Willa, the daughter of Boso. Berengar had
been at the court of Hugh, when that King had made
a plan to seize and blind him. But he received timely
warning from Lothair, King Hugh’s son, and had fled.
Finding discontent rife, he placed himself at the head
of the Italian princes and nobles.</p>

<p>After his abandonment of the Mountains of the
Moors, and having come to terms with the Saracens,
Hugh hastened into Italy, only to find that his cause
was lost. Amidst general execration, he was forced to
retire into Provence in 946, and there he died three
years later, in the odour of sanctity.</p>

<p>Thenceforth for awhile the Moors were left undisturbed,
to continue their ravages. Berengar and his son
even contracted alliance with them. But at last an
effort was made to be rid of the incubus. And the
person who was the motive force to set the Count of
Provence in action was S. Majolus.</p>

<p>Majolus was born of wealthy parents about the year
908, near Riez, in Provence. But owing to an incursion
of the Saracens the family estate was ruined, houses
were burnt, crops destroyed, and the peasants killed or
carried off as captives. Majolus took refuge in Macon
with his uncle, who was bishop. Then he became a
monk at Cluny. In 948 the abbot Aymard resigned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and appointed Majolus to succeed him. But the ex-abbot
one day, whilst in the infirmary, fancied a bit of
cheese, and screamed for it to be brought to him. No
one paid attention to his angry and repeated yells, as the
monks at the time were themselves dining. Aymard was
so offended at this neglect that he deposed Majolus and
resumed the headship of the establishment. But on his
death Majolus was elected in his room. After a visit to
Rome, Majolus was on his way back when a band of
Saracen marauders took him. Seeing one of the Moors
about to cleave the head of one of his companions whom
they considered not likely to fetch a ransom, Majolus
sprang forward and interposed his arm. He saved the
life of his comrade, but long suffered from the wound.
The Saracens forced the monks of Cluny to pay the
heavy ransom of a thousand pounds of silver for their
abbot.</p>

<p>Majolus had now suffered twice from these scourges of
the South, and he preached a crusade against them in 972.</p>

<p>It took him ten years, however, to rouse the Provençals
to undertake the expulsion of the Moors, so
cowed and despairing had they become. He was ably
assisted by one Bavo, son of Adelfried, a noble of
Nuglerium (Noyers, near Sistèron?), who had taken a
vow to avenge the honour of his wife, who had been
outraged by a Saracen. This man swore to exterminate
every Moor who came within reach of his arm.
Eventually he died at Voghera, on a pilgrimage to
Rome to give thanks for victory over the Moors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>William, Count of Provence, at the instigation of
Majolus, took up arms against the Moors, and hemmed
them into the chain of mountains that still bears their
name. The campaign lasted through several years, till
finally the main stronghold, Le Grand Fraxinet, was
taken. After this, one fort and then another fell, and
the boats were captured and burnt. William did not
massacre the infidels, but reduced them to servitude,
and their descendants continued to live on in Provence
in this condition. Romeo de Villeneuve, in his will,
dated 1250, ordered his male and female Saracen slaves
to be sold.</p>

<p>William of Provence had been aided by a Grimaldi
from Genoa; he made his prisoners build the walls of
Nice and cultivate the soil. To this day a quarter of
Nice bears the name of <i>lou canton dei sarraïs</i>, for it was
here that these people were interned. Grimaldi, for his
services, was granted lands in the Chaine des Maures,
and the Golf de Grimaud and the town of Grimaud
take their name from him. The Grimaldi family comes
first into notice covered with honour, as liberators of the
Christian from plunderers and pirates. The Grimaldi of
to-day at Monaco are known as living on the proceeds
of the gaming tables of Monte Carlo, the plunderers of
Christendom.</p>

<p>Le Grand Fraxinet itself may be visited, but there
remain few traces of the Saracen stronghold; some
substructures and a cistern are all. It has been supposed
and asserted that the natives of the town, in their
cast of feature, in their dark eyes and hair, in the pose of
their bodies, still proclaim their Moorish descent. No
one who has been in Tunis or Algiers will corroborate
this. In fact, the inhabitants are indistinguishable from
other Provençals.</p>

<p>Cogolin and Grimaud are two little towns living upon,
and smelling of, cork, at a very little distance apart.
The Castle of Cogolin has been wholly destroyed, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for a bell tower. That of Grimaud is in better condition,
but is a ruin. The place was taken from the
Grimaldis in 1378 by Louis I. of Anjou and Provence,
as the Grimaldi of that time had sided in the war of
succession with Charles of Durazzo, and he gave it to
Christopher Adorno. It passed from one to another,
and was raised into a marquisate in 1627; but the castle
was dismantled in virtue of a decree in 1655.</p>

<p>The town is curious, built on a conical hill dominated
by the castle. The streets are narrow. The church is
rude, Early Romanesque, and very curious.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the sea originally ran up to Cogolin and
Grimaud. Now all the basin out of which they rise is a
flat alluvial plain intersected by dykes, and growing,
near La Foux, splendid umbrella pines.</p>

<p>S. Tropez, charming little town as it is, the best centre
for excursions in the Chain of the Maures, is nevertheless
not a place that can ever become a winter residence, as it
looks to the north and is lashed by the terrible Mistral.
But it has this advantage denied to the other towns on
the coast, that, having the sun at the back, one looks
from it upon the sea in all its intensity of colour without
being dazzled.</p>

<p>S. Tropez has been supposed to occupy the site of a
Phœnician-Greek town, Heraclea Caccabaria, but this is
improbable. This place was almost certainly in the
sweet sun-bathed Bay of Cavalaire. There were, indeed,
two ancient towns on the Gulf, Alcone and Athenopolis;
and certainly Grimaud was a town in Roman times, for
there are remains of the aqueduct that supplied it with
water.</p>

<p>The Gulf was called Sinus Sambracitanus, and, as
already stated, at one time reached inland to the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Grimaud. And at Cogolin a Greek funerary monument
has been found.</p>

<p>S. Tropez was completely ruined by the Saracens
when they occupied the Maures. After they were
driven out it was rebuilt, but was again destroyed in
the War of Succession between the Duke of Anjou
and Charles of Durazzo. It was rebuilt under King
Réné and colonised by some Genoese families, who
fortified it and undertook to defend it. In 1592 it
gallantly resisted the Duke of Savoy, and forced him
to retire. In 1652 S. Tropez was a prey to civil
war between the <i>Sabreurs</i> and the <i>Canifets</i>, who had
succeeded to the feud of the Carcists and Razats. The
Sabreurs were those representing military force, the
Canifets represented the <i>échevins</i>, and were nicknamed
after the <i>canif</i> used by the latter to mend their pens. I
shall have more to say about this when we come to
Draguignan. The Sabreurs got possession of the castle,
but the Duc de Mercœur sent a regiment to assist the
citizens, and the Sabreurs were dislodged.</p>

<p>The town is divided into two parts&mdash;the old town and
the new&mdash;and the former teems with picturesque features
that attract the artist. The women of S. Tropez are
noted for their good looks, due to the infusion of Italian
blood. S. Tropez is the scene of a peculiar festival, <i>La
Bravade</i>, taking place on the 16th, 17th, and 18th May
every year, in commemoration of the defence of the town
against the Duke of Savoy in 1637; combined with the
patronal feast of S. Tropez on May 17th. Every Monday
in Easter week a Captain of the Town is elected
for the ensuing year, and he has the regulation of the
festival. This is initiated on May Day, or the next
Sunday and Thursday, by the “Promenade des Joies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>”
when members of a company carrying hoops adorned
with many-coloured fluttering ribbons, promenade the
town, led by drummers. On May 16th, at 3 p.m., the
Captain, with his attendant officers, marches to the
Mairie, where he is presented with pike and banner
by the Mayor, to a discharge of firearms, which thenceforth
go on banging day and night till the evening of
the ensuing day. The guns are discharged at any
passer-by, but only at the legs&mdash;and are, of course,
charged with powder alone. The clergy, led by the
cross, escorted by the beadles, arrive from the church
and bless the guns and other weapons. Then the
Bravadeurs follow to the church, where they receive
the bust of S. Tropez, and the procession starts
capering, dancing, swaying in and out of the streets,
through the town, fifes screaming, drums rolling, guns
exploding. The procession moves to the Port, where
the Captain and all his company salute the sea. Whereupon
any gunboats, torpedo boats, etc., that happen to
be anchored in the harbour, return the salute by a general
thunder of guns.</p>

<p>But the 17th&mdash;the day of S. Tropez&mdash;is that of greatest
festivity. It opens with a Mass of the <i>Mousquetaires</i> at
8 a.m., after which follows a general procession. In the
afternoon the Bravade marches to the Mairie and the
pikes and banner are surrendered. On May 18th, at
8 a.m., is a Mass at the chapel of S. Anne; around the
chapel are ranged stalls of sellers of black nougat and a
sort of cake known by the name of <i>fougasette</i>. Then
ensues a <i>déjeuner</i> given by the Captain to his assistants
and to the town authorities; and in the evening the
festival concludes with a general farandol on the <i>Lices</i>.</p>

<span class="mid">S. RAPHAEL AND FRÉJUS</span></h2>

<p class="pch">Rapid Rise&mdash;An exposed spot, unsuitable as a winter resort&mdash;Napoleon
here embarks for Elba: his journey from Fontainebleau&mdash;The via
Aurelia&mdash;Fréjus&mdash;Choking up of the harbour&mdash;Roman remains&mdash;The
Cathedral&mdash;Agricola&mdash;Monuments&mdash;S. Hilary&mdash;Sieyès; sans phrases&mdash;Désauguier&mdash;The
Caveau&mdash;His Carnival Lay&mdash;Some of his jokes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">A FEW years ago S. Raphael was a fishing village
about an old Templar church. There were in it
but a couple of hundred poor folk. Then some speculators
cast their eyes on the place, and calculating, not
unreasonably, on the lack of intelligence of visitors from
the North, resolved on making it into a winter sanatorium.
They bought out the fisher families, and set to work to
build hotels and lay out esplanades and gardens.</p>

<p>Now any person with a grain of sense in his head has
but to look at the map to see that S. Raphael is the very
last place on the coast suitable as a winter resort. It
lies between two great humps of mountains, the Chaine
des Maures and the Estérel. It has before it the ever-shallowing
Gulf of Fréjus, that stretches back into
alluvial deposit and pestiferous morasses&mdash;open to the
north; and down this bare, unwholesome plain roars and
rages the Mistral. It has blown the sea out of the Bay
to the distance of two miles. It is enough, entering the
ears, to drive the frail lungs out of the breast betwixt
the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Argens, which has flowed from west to east, receiving
the drainage of the Montagnes des Maures,
receives also the Parturby and the Endre from the limestone,
and then turns about and runs almost due south,
but with an incline to the east. It forms a wide basin,
once a long arm of sea, but now filled up with deposit,
and with festering lagoons sprinkled over its surface;
the two great mountain chains from east and west
contract, and force the winds that come down from the
north, and the snows of the Alps, to concentrate their
malice on S. Raphael. If you love a draught, then sit
before a roaring fire, with an open window behind you.
If you desire a draught on a still larger scale, go to
S. Raphael.</p>

<p>Perhaps the speculators who invented this <i>Station
Hivernale</i> thought that it was necessary to add something
more, in order to attract patients to the place, and Valescure
was established among pine woods. The aromatic
scent of the terebinth, its sanatory properties, so highly
estimated, so experimentally efficacious in pulmonary
disorders, etc., etc. Valescure is just as certainly exposed
to winds as is S. Raphael. As to pines and
eucalyptus, they can be had elsewhere, in combination
with shelter.</p>

<p>However, let me quote M. Leuthéric, who has a good
word to say for S. Raphael:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Few regions of Provence present conditions of landscape
and climate (!!) more seductive. The little town of Saint
Raphael is placed beyond the zone of infection from the
marshes of Fréjus. It stretches gracefully along the shore at
the foot of the savage chain of the Estérel. On all sides
pointed rocks of red porphyry pierce the sombre foliage of
cork trees and pines. The coast is fringed by sandbanks,
extending along under cliffs covered with ilexes. A little way
out to sea, two tawny-coloured rocks, like fantastic beasts at
rest, close the harbour, and receive over their long backs the
foam of the breakers; the first is couched some cable lengths
from the shore, the second five hundred metres beyond it.
They bear the names of the Land and the Sea Lions.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>It was here that Napoleon entered the vessel deporting
him to Elba, attended by the Commissioners of the
Allied Powers. He had left Fontainebleau upon April
20th, 1814. As he got south he was made to perceive
that his popularity, if he ever had any in Provence, was
gone. Near Valence he encountered Augereau, whom
he had created Duke of Castiglione, and who was an
underbred, coarse fellow. Napoleon and his Marshal
met on the 24th. Napoleon took off his hat, but
Augereau, with vulgar insolence, kept his on. “Where
are you going?” asked the fallen Emperor, “to Court?”&mdash;“I
care for the Bourbons as little as I do for you,”
answered Augereau: “all I care for is my country.”
Upon this, Napoleon turned his back on him, and re-entered
the carriage. Augereau would not even then
remove his hat and bow, but saluted his former master
with a contemptuous wave of the hand.</p>

<p>At Valence, Napoleon saw, for the first time, French
soldiers wearing the white cockade. At Orange the air
rang with cries of “<i>Vive le Roy!</i>”</p>

<p>On arrival at Orgon the populace yelled, “Down with
the Corsican! Death to the tyrant! <i>Vive le Roy!</i>”
Portraits of Bonaparte were burnt before his eyes; an
effigy of himself was fluttered before the carriage
window, with the breast pierced, and dripping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
blood. A crowd of furious women screamed, “What
have you done with our children?” The Commissioners
were obliged to stand about the carriage to protect
him; and it was with difficulty that a way could be
made through the mob for the carriages to proceed.
At Saint Cannat the crowd broke the windows of his
coach. Then, for his protection, he assumed a cap and
a greatcoat of Austrian uniform, and instead of pursuing
his way in the coach, entered a cabriolet. The carriages
did not overtake the Emperor till they reached La
Calade. The escort found him standing by the fire in
the kitchen of the inn, talking with the hostess. She
had asked him whether the tyrant was soon to pass
that way. “Ah, sir,” she said, “it is all nonsense to
assert that we are rid of him. I have always said that
we never shall be sure of being quit of him till he is
thrown to the bottom of a well and it is then filled in
with stones. I only wish that well were mine in the
yard. Why, the Directory sent him to Egypt to get rid
of him, and he returned.” Here the woman, having
finished skimming her pot, looked up, and perceived
that all the party was standing uncovered, except the
person whom she was addressing. She was confounded,
and her embarrassment amused the ex-Emperor and
dispelled his annoyance.</p>

<p>The <i>sous-préfet</i> of Aix closed the gates of the town to
prevent the people from issuing forth. At a château
near Napoleon met his sister Pauline, who was ill, or
pretended to be ill, and was staying there. When he
entered to embrace her, she started back. “Oh,
Napoleon, why this uniform?”</p>

<p>“Pauline,” replied he, “do you wish that I were
dead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The princess, looking at him steadfastly, replied, “I
cannot kiss you in that Austrian dress. Oh, Napoleon,
what have you done?”</p>

<p>The ex-Emperor at once retired, and having substituted
a greatcoat of his Old Guard for the Austrian
suit, entered the chamber of his sister, who ran to him
and embraced him tenderly. Then, going to the
window, he saw a crowd in the court in a very uncertain
temper. He descended at once, and noticing among
them an old man with a gash across his nose and a red
ribbon in his button-hole, he went up to him at once,
and asked, “Are you not Jacques Dumont?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Sire!” And the old soldier drew himself
up and saluted.</p>

<p>“You were wounded, but it seems to me that it was
long ago.”</p>

<p>“Sire, at the battle of Tebia, with General Suchet.
I was unable to serve longer. But even now, whenever
the drum beats, I feel like a deserter. Under your
ensign, Sire, I could still serve whenever your Majesty
would command.” The old man shed tears as he said,
“My name! To recollect that after fifteen years!” All
hesitation among the crowd as to how they would
receive Napoleon was at an end. He had won every
heart.</p>

<p>Napoleon, as it happens, had a very bad memory for
names. What is probable is, that Pauline pointed the
old soldier out to her brother from the window, and
named him, before Napoleon descended.</p>

<p>The English frigate, the <i>Undaunted</i>, was lying in the
Gulf of Fréjus. The fallen Emperor manifested considerable
reluctance to go on board. However, on
April 28th he sailed from S. Raphael, and after a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
passage disembarked at Porto Ferrajo, the capital of
Elba, on the 4th of May.</p>

<p>The great Roman road, the Via Aurelia, left the
capital of the world by the Janiculan Gate, made for
Pisa, Lucca, followed the coast the whole way, passed
above where is now Monaco, over a spur of the Maritime
Alps by Nice, Antibes, Cannes, came to a little
town in the lap of the Gulf of Fréjus, and thence
turned abruptly away from the coast and made direct
for Aix and Arles. Thence roads radiated: one, leading
up the left bank of the Rhone, took troops and commerce
to the Rhine. Thence also the Domitian Way
conveyed both by Narbonne into Spain.</p>

<p>This bay was the last harbour on the Mediterranean
for troops that were to march into the heart of Gaul, to
Britain, or to the Rhine. Hitherto the road, hugging
the coast, offered innumerable facilities for provisioning
soldiery and supplying them with munitions of war.
But from the Bay of Fréjus this advantage ceased.
Julius Cæsar saw the great strategical importance of the
harbour, and he resolved to make of it an important
haven, a naval station, and an emporium for stores.
Marseilles he did not choose. It was a commercial
town, a Greek town, and he was out of temper with it
for having sided with Pompey against him. Accordingly
he settled here some veterans of his favourite Tenth
Legion, to become the nucleus of a colony. But Cæsar
overlooked what was a most important point&mdash;his port
Forum Julii was planted at the mouth of the Argens,
and the river brought down a vast amount of fluviatile
deposit, mud and sand, and inevitably in a few years
would silt up his port. It had a further disadvantage&mdash;it
was a fever trap. To the south the town had a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tract of fetid marsh, breeding malaria and mosquitoes.
He would have done well to have swallowed his resentment
against Marseilles and to have taken the opinion
of so observant a man as Vitruvius, or even to have
studied the conditions himself more closely. Now all
the harbour is buried in silt, and grass grows where
galleys floated. The lap of the bay, which was once at
Fréjus, begins now at S. Raphael and extends to Cap
S. Aigous. In time S. Raphael also will be inland, and
the Lion de Mer will become, like its fellow, a Lion
de Terre.</p>

<p>Michel de l’Hôpital, who lived in the sixteenth
century, in one of his letters wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We arrived at Fréjus, which is nothing more now but a
poor little town. Here are grand ruins of an ancient theatre,
foundered arcades, baths, aqueduct, and scattered remains of
quays and basins. The port has disappeared under sand, and
is now nothing but a field and a beach.”</p>

<p class="p1">If S. Raphael be devoid of antiquities and of history,
at a little distance is Fréjus, that has both in abundance.</p>

<p>The ruins are many, but not beautiful; everything
was built in a hurry, and badly built. The aqueduct
was no sooner completed than it gave way and had to
be patched up. The triumphal arch on the old quays
is a shabby affair. The amphitheatre is half cut out
of the natural rock. There was plenty of granite and
porphyry accessible, but the builders did not trouble
themselves to obtain large and solid blocks; they built
of brick and small stones, without skill and impatiently.
The work was probably executed by corvées of labourers
impressed from the country round. There were two
enormous citadels; one to the north, the other to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
south of the port. The latter, the Butte S. Antoine,
was, however, mainly a huge accumulation of store
chambers, magazines for whatever was needed for the
soldiers, and attached to it was the lighthouse. Beyond,
some way on the ancient mole, is the most perfect monument
of Roman times extant in Fréjus. It goes by the
name of La Lantern; but it was not a lighthouse at all,
but the lodge of a harbour-master, who gave directions
with a flag to vessels how to enter the harbour and
avoid the shoals.</p>

<p>The railway now runs close to it across the ancient
basin, the port made by Agrippa. To the north of this,
where stands now the chapel of S. Roch, was the Port
of Cæsar. Poplars now stand where was formerly a
forest of masts.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre is cut through its entire length by
a road. The old wall of the town reached to it, included
it, and then drew back to where is now the railway
station. The remains of the theatre are to the north
of the modern town, and those of the baths to the south-west;
they may be reached by taking a road in that
direction from the Butte S. Antoine.</p>

<p>Although Julius Cæsar has the credit of having made
the place and called it after his own name, it is certainly
more than a guess that there was a Græco-Phœnician
settlement here before that time, occupying the bunch
of high ground rising above the marshes of the Argens.
Indeed, monuments have been found that imply as
much, though later in date than the making of the
place into a naval station by Cæsar. One of these is
bi-lingual&mdash;Latin and Greek. It begins in Latin:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“To Caius Vilius Ligur, this is dedicated by his mother
Maxima.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">Then comes Greek:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“This tomb had been constructed for those much older;
but Destiny, under the influence of the country and climate,
has smitten a child of seven years. His parents, his father
and mother, have buried him whom they brought up. Vain
are the hopes of men here below.”</p>

<p class="pn1">It is noticeable that this child bore the name of Ligur,
living and dying among the Ligurians of the coast.
Possibly the family had this native blood in their veins
and were not ashamed of it. Another tomb is all in
Latin:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Agrippina Pia to the Memory of her Friend Baricbal. He
lived forty years. She who was his heiress has constructed
this monument for him and herself.”</p>

<p class="pn1">And underneath are a pair of clasped hands.</p>

<p>What was the story? The name Baricbal is Barac
Baal, the Blessed of Baal, the name of a Phœnician.
The young heiress undertakes to be buried in the same
tomb with him later. But she was an heiress, and she
was young. I doubt if her resolution held out, and
she did not clasp hands after a year or two with some
one else.</p>

<p>The cathedral is not particularly interesting; it is of
the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The baptistery is
earlier, and sustained by eight Corinthian columns of
granite taken from a Roman building. The cloisters
are good, the arches resting on pairs of columns. Fréjus
has produced some remarkable men. First of all comes
Agricola, the father-in-law of Tacitus, who wrote his
life. From that biography we see what an honourable,
true, and in every way upright man an old Roman could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
be. Agricola was born in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 37 and died in 93. His life
is of special interest to us, as he spent so much of his
time in Britain, carried the Roman arms into Scotland,
and sent an expedition round the coast and established
the fact that Britain was an island. He was moved
to this by the following circumstance. A body of
Germans had been levied on the Rhine and were sent
over to serve under Agricola. But after having murdered
a centurion and some soldiers who were drilling them,
they seized on three light vessels and compelled the
captains to go on board with them. One of these,
however, escaped to shore, whereupon these Germans
murdered the other two, put to sea, and sailed away
without one of them having any acquaintance with the
sea and the management of ships. They were carried
north by winds and waves, and landed occasionally to
obtain water and food and to plunder the natives. They
circumnavigated the north of Scotland, and then were
carried out to sea and suffered terrible privations. They
were driven by starvation to kill and eat the weakest
of their number and to drink their blood. At length
they were wrecked on the North German coast, where
they were seized on as pirates, and sold as slaves to the
Romans on the left bank of the Rhine. Here they
talked and yarned of their adventures, and the news
reached Agricola; so he fitted out his expedition and
proved the fact that Britain actually was an island.
Finally, owing to his success, he fell under suspicion to
the jealous tyrant Domitian and was recalled to Rome,
where he died; whether poisoned by the Emperor or
died a natural death is uncertain. Tacitus himself does
not venture to pass an opinion.</p>

<p>Another great native of Fréjus was S. Hilary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Arles. He was born of noble parents in the year 401,
and was a relative of Honoratus, abbot of Lerins.
Honoratus left his retirement to seek his kinsman
Hilary and draw him to embrace the monastic life; but
all his persuasion was at first in vain. “What floods
of tears,” says Hilary, “did this true friend shed to
soften my hard heart! How often did he embrace me
with the most tender and compassionate affection, to
wring from me a resolve that I would consider the
salvation of my soul. Yet I resisted.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Honoratus, “I will obtain from God
what you refuse.” And he left him. Three days later
Hilary had changed his mind, and went to Lerins to
place himself under the discipline of Honoratus. In
428 S. Hilary was elected Archbishop of Arles. He
was a man of a very impetuous and wilful character, and
got sadly embroiled with Pope Leo the Great, whom
he defied on behalf of the liberties of the Gallican
Church, speaking out to him, as his contemporary
biographer asserts, “words that no layman would dare
to utter, no ecclesiastic would endure to hear.” He had
after this to escape from Rome, where assassination was
to be feared&mdash;by knife or poison&mdash;and hurried back to
Arles. Leo retorted by writing a letter to the bishops
of the province of Vienne denouncing the audacity of
Hilary in daring to set himself up against his authority,
and releasing them from all allegiance to the see of
Arles.</p>

<p>Soon after this a fresh quarrel broke out. A bishop
Projectus complained that when he was ill, Hilary had
rushed into his diocese without inquiring whether he
were yet dead, and without calling on the clergy and
people to elect a successor, had consecrated another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bishop in his room. This was the best possible medicine
for Projectus. He tumbled out of bed, pulled on his
clothes, and in a screaming rage wrote a letter to the
Pope. Thereupon Leo wrote sharply to Hilary to bid
him mind his own business in future, and not meddle
out of his diocese. And then the Pope wrung from the
feeble Emperor Valentinian an edict denouncing the
contumacy of Hilary against the apostolic throne, and
requiring him and all the bishops of Gaul to submit as
docile children to the bishop of the Eternal City. Hilary
died in 449, comparatively young.</p>

<p>Sieyès was born at Fréjus in 1748, and was trained for
orders at S. Sulpice. In 1788 he was sent as member
for the clerical order to the Provincial Assembly at
Orléans. He saw what was the trend of opinion and
what must inevitably happen, and he wrote his trenchant
pamphlets, <i>Essai sur les Privilèges and Qu’est-ce que le
tiers-état</i>, 1789, that acted as firebrands through France.
He was elected by Paris as representative at the General
Assembly that met at Versailles. There, looking at the
nobles in their sumptuous attire, the curés in their
<i>soutannes</i>, and the representatives of the Third Estate
in their humble cloth, he said, “One people!&mdash;We are
three nations,” and he it was who, on July 20th, on
entering the Assembly, exclaimed, “It is time now to
cut the cords,” and sent an imperious message to the
other two Houses to enter and sit along with the
Tiers État.</p>

<p>He strove hard against the abolition of tithe without
some compensation to the clergy, but was overborne.
The general feeling was against this. As he saw that
anarchy was resulting from the conduct of the Assembly
he withdrew from taking any further active part; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he was elected by the Department of Sarthe to sit as
deputy in the Convention.</p>

<p>At the trial of Louis XIV. he voted for his death&mdash;“La
mort&mdash;sans phrases.” When in 1798 he was commissioned
by the Directory as Ambassador to Berlin, he
sent an invitation to a German prince to dine with him.
The prince wrote across it, “Non&mdash;sans phrases.” He
was elected into the Council of the Five Hundred. At
this time it was that the half-crazy fanatical Cordelier
Poule attempted to shoot him. Sieyès struck the pistol
aside, but was wounded in the hand and shoulder.
Poule was sentenced for this for twenty years to the
galleys, and died on them. Sieyès was a member
of the Directory. He was a great man for drawing
up schemes for a Constitution. The Directory had
lost all credit; France was sick of its constituent
Assemblies, Legislative Assemblies, Conventions, and
Directory. This latter, at one moment feeble, at the
next violent, seemed to be able to govern only by
successive <i>coups d’état</i>, always a token of weakness. It
had brought France to the verge of bankruptcy. In its
foreign policy it had committed gross imprudences, and
now a new coalition had been formed against France,
and the armies had met with reverses in Italy and
Germany. At this juncture Napoleon landed at S.
Raphael. As he travelled to Paris he was everywhere
greeted with enthusiasm as the expected saviour of the
country. But on reaching Paris he behaved with
caution; he seemed only to live for his sister, and for
his wife, Josephine, and for his colleagues of the Institut.
But he was watching events. Everyone was then
conspiring; Sieyès in the Directory, Fouché and Talleyrand
in the ministry, a hundred others in the Conseils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Sieyès said, “What is wanting for France is a head,”
tapping his own brow, “and a sword,” looking significantly
at Napoleon. He was to learn very soon that
head and sword would go together.</p>

<p>The 18th Brumaire was contrived by Sieyès; but
he was in his coach, outside S. Cloud, when Napoleon
entered to dissolve the Council of the Five Hundred.
In face of the tumult within Bonaparte lost his confidence
and was thrust forth by the Deputies. He found
Sieyès in his carriage, to which were harnessed six horses,
ready to start at full gallop should the <i>coup</i> fail. “Do
they seek to outlaw you?” asked Sieyès. “Man, outlaw
them yourself.” Napoleon recovered himself and
re-entered the hall at the head of his soldiery. The
situation was saved.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, Sieyès, and Roger-Ducros were nominated
Consuls. The Revolution had abdicated into the hands
of the military. That same evening Sieyès said to his
intimates, “We have given ourselves a master.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, Bonaparte, as first Consul, took him into
the Senate, and granted to him the domains of Crosne.
Later, it was said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Bonaparte à Sieyès a fait présent de Crosne,<br />
Sieyès à Bonaparte a fait présent de trône.”</p>

<p class="p1">Under the empire Sieyès was created a count.</p>

<p>During the Hundred Days, Sieyès took his place in the
Chamber of Peers, but at the second restoration he was
banished as one of the regicides. He went to Brussels,
but after the Revolution of 1830 returned to Paris, where
he died in 1836.</p>

<p>To finish with one more worthy, of a character very
different from the rest: Marc Antoine Désaugiers. Born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
at Féjus in 1772, he died in 1827. He was the soul
of the <i>Caveau Moderne</i>.</p>

<p>The old Caveau had been founded by Piron, Collé,
and others. They met twice a month at the wine-shop
of Landelle, where they produced songs, stories, and
epigrams they had composed, dined and drank together.
This réunion began in 1737, and lasted over
ten years.</p>

<p>After the 9th Thermidor, and the fall of Robespierre,
the Terror was at an end. Men began to breathe
freely, lift up their heads, and look about for amusements
to indemnify themselves for the reign of horrors
they had passed through. Then some choice spirits
renewed the reminiscences of the old Caveau, and met
near the Theatre of the Vaudeville, opened in 1792.
The songs that were sung, the stories there told, flew
about. The public desired to share in the merriment,
and in Vendémiaire of the year V. (September, 1796)
appeared the first number of the <i>Caveau Moderne</i>. The
tavern at which the company met was “Le Rocher de
Cancalle.” A complete edition of the songs was published
in 1807. The tunes to which the songs were set
were either well-known folk-melodies, or opera-house
airs.</p>

<p>Désaugiers was a large contributor.</p>

<p>As a specimen of his style I give some stanzas of
his “Carnaval.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Momus agite ses grelots,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Désaugiers was one day invited to preside at the
annual dinner of the pork butchers. After the table
was cleared he rose, and all expected the oration or
song of the evening. Looking round with a twinkle in
his eye, he began&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Des Cochons, des Cochons.”</p>

<p class="p1">The pork butchers bridled up, grew red with wrath,
thinking that this was intended as an insult, when
Désaugiers proceeded with his song&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Décochons les traits de la satire.”</p>

<p class="p1">A French author has said of him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Désaugiers is song personified;&mdash;all gaiety, fun, laughter.
He has in him something of the spirit of Rabelais. His
inherent wit breaks out like the effervescence of champagne.
Thought and rhyme are born in him along with song. Every
refrain in his compositions is full of joyous sparkle.”</p>

<span class="mid">DRAGUIGNAN</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap06">DRAGUIGNAN is the capital of the Department of
Var. The name of the department is a misnomer.
It received the name when the department extended to
that river, formerly the boundary of France. But when,
in 1860, Nice was ceded to France and the department of
the Maritime Alps was formed, then a slice of territory,
through which flowed the River Var, was detached and
united to the newly constituted department. The consequence
is that the River Var at no point runs through
the department to which it gave its name.</p>

<p>Draguignan is not an interesting town. It lives on its
character as departmental capital. It has no manufactures,
no trade, no life save that which is infused into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
it when the young folk come up there for examination
for professions, and from the military who are quartered
there, and from the prisons which accommodate the
criminals of the department. Draguignan is supposed
to have been a Greek town called Antea. But there
must have been people living here in prehistoric times,
for near the town is a dolmen as fine as any in Brittany
or Wales. It is composed of four upright stones supporting
a quoit eighteen feet long and fifteen wide, and
the height above the ground is seven feet.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the place was called Drachœnum,
and it was fabled that the old town stood on the
heights above, as the plain was ravaged by a dragon.
St. Armentarius, Bishop of Antibes (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 451) slew the
monster, whereupon the people came down from the
heights and settled where is the present town. The
town really began to flourish in the thirteenth century,
when, owing to the silting up of the port of Fréjus, that
city declined in prosperity. Then it was surrounded by
a wall pierced by three gates, of which two remain.
Within the old walls the streets are scarce six feet
wide, and the houses run up to a great height. The sun
never penetrates to their pavement. The town was
also defended by a castle on rising ground. In 1535
Draguignan was one of the principal Sénéchaussées of
Provence. She rapidly spread beyond the walls, and
then a second circuit of walls was erected where is now
the boulevard; but portions of the ramparts to the east
and north-east still remain.</p>

<p>In 1650 Draguignan was the scene of bloody fights
on account of the troubles of the Fronde. During the
minority of Louis XIV., the Regent, Anne of Austria,
committed all authority to Cardinal Mazarin. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
loaded the country with taxes, took away the privileges
from the towns, and from the nobles, and strove to
centralise the Government and establish the despotism
of the Crown. This roused the fiercest opposition, and
the country was divided into factions; one for the Court
and centralization, the other for the maintenance of
local self-government. This latter party was the Fronde.
In Draguignan some Frondists attempted to get hold of
the castle; the people rose, armed with spits and clubs,
and drove them away. The parties distinguished themselves
by wearing ribbons, white or blue.</p>

<p>Two years later civil war broke out again between the
Sabreurs, the Fronde party, and the Canifets, the
favourers of Royal prerogative; each was headed by
a young peasantess armed with a scythe. Frightful
violence ensued. The mayor and many officers of the
town were killed. Men, women, and children were massacred
indiscriminately as this or that faction got the
upper hand.</p>

<p>The king sent troops to Draguignan, and ordered the
demolition of the castle, which was the bone of contention
between the parties, and most of the Sabreurs fled
into Piedmont. The story goes that a cavalry regiment
called La Cornette blanche was quartered in the town,
and having behaved with great insolence, the people
rose in the night and massacred every man in the
regiment, But in the municipal records there is nothing
to be found to confirm the tradition.</p>

<p>Les Tourettes by Fayence, easily accessible from
Draguignan, is a most extraordinary pile, like no other
castle known. In the time of the religious wars it was
held by the Carcists, and they, being short of provisions,
at night raided the neighbourhood. The people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Fayence complained to the Governor of Provence, and
he authorised them to take what measures they liked to
free themselves of the inconvenience. Accordingly
they sent for a cannon from Antibes and proceeded to
batter the castle down; and by keeping up an incessant
fire they made the castle too hot for the Carcists, who
fled, and then the good folk of Fayence proceeded to
gut and unroof the castle, so as to save themselves from
further annoyance from that quarter.</p>

<p>Draguignan was supplied with water by a canal cut,
so it is asserted, by Queen Jeanne I. of Sicily, and she
is also credited with having built the church at Salernes
at the confluence of the Bresgne and the Brague, and to
have resided at Draguignan.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that only two names of their former
rulers have any hold on the imagination and hearts of
the Provençals of to-day, and these the names of two
totally different characters&mdash;<i>la reino Jeanno</i> and good
King Réné. It was through Queen Joanna or Jeanne
of Sicily that King Réné acquired his empty royal titles.
At Grasse a flight of stone steps built into a vaulted
passage is all that remains of her palace. Houses said
to have been occupied by her are pointed out in many
places, but in some instances, as in that of the pretty
Renaissance palace of Queen Jeanne at Les Baux,
there is confusion made between her and Jeanne de
Laval, the wife of King Réné.</p>

<p>It may be asked, How in the name of Wonder did
Joanna obtain the title of Queen of Jerusalem, so as to
transmit the Crown of the Holy City to Réné through
her grandniece, Joanna II.?</p>

<p>The bitter and implacable hostility borne by the
Popes to the German Imperial House of Hohenstauffen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
led Urban IV. to invite S. Louis, King of France, to
assume the title of King of Sicily and Naples. But the
delicate conscience of Louis revolted from such an
usurpation. If the Crown were hereditary, it belonged
to Conradin, grandson of Frederick II., the Great
Redbeard, Emperor, King of Germany and of Sicily.
But Charles of Anjou, the brother of S. Louis, was less
scrupulous. He accepted the invitation. On the death
of Urban, Clement IV. pursued the same policy. Manfred,
the uncle of Conradin, then wore the Crown of
the Sicilies. He was defeated by Charles and fell in
battle, 1266, before the army of the Pope and of Charles
of Anjou, marching as crusaders. Manfred left an only
child, Constance, married to Peter III., King of Aragon.
Conradin, at the head of an army, advanced to claim
the Crown that was now his by right, regardless of
the excommunication and curses hurled at him by
the Pope. He was defeated and taken prisoner.
Clement, fearful lest Charles should deal leniently towards
the last of the Hohenstaufens, wrote to urge him
to smother all feelings of pity.</p>

<p>“The life of Conradin,” he wrote, “is the death of
Charles; the death of Conradin is the life of Charles”;
and the Anjou prince had the last male of this noble
race executed publicly. As Conradin stood on the
scaffold, he flung his glove among the people, crying out
that he constituted the King of Aragon his heir.</p>

<p>Charles was now King of the Two Sicilies. But he
was ambitious of a more splendid title, and he bought
that of Jerusalem from Mary of Antioch, daughter
of Bohimund V., who inherited the title of King of
Jerusalem from his mother, Melusina, daughter of
Amaury de Lusignan, twelfth sovereign of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
kingdom of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem itself had fallen
into the hands of the Saracens in 1244.</p>

<p>To return now to Jeanne de Naples.</p>

<p>Joanna I. of Naples was born in 1327, and was the
daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, and of Marie de
Valois, his second wife. Charles was the only son of
Robert the Good, King of Naples, who was the grandson
of Charles of Anjou, brother of S. Louis, to whom
had been given the Crown of Naples by Pope Urban IV.,
determined at any cost to destroy the Hohenstauffen
dynasty.</p>

<p>Charles, Duke of Calabria, died before his father,
and Joanna succeeded to the throne at the age of
sixteen.</p>

<p>She had been badly brought up. Philippine Cabane,
a washerwoman, wife of a fisherman, had been nurse to
Charles, and she became later the nurse and confidante
of Joanna. She was a very beautiful and a thoroughly
unprincipled woman. On the death of her husband she
married a young Saracen slave in the service of Raymond
de Cabane, <i>maître d’hôtel</i> to the King. Raymond
fell under the influence of this Saracen, and he introduced
him to King Robert, who created him Grand
Seneschal, to the indignation of the Sicilian nobility, and
himself armed the Saracen knight.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Soon after marrying
this man, we find “la Cabanaise,” as she was called,
installed as lady of honour to Catherine of Austria, first
wife of Charles of Calabria. Soon she induced Raymond
to adopt her husband, and to give him his title and
bequeath his fortune to him. Catherine of Austria died,
and then Charles married Marie de Valois; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Jeanne or Joanna was born, Charles entrusted his child
to this infamous woman.</p>

<p>King Robert had been younger brother of Charles
Martel, King of Hungary, and the Crown of Naples was
liable to be disputed between the branches. It was
therefore deemed advisable to marry Joanna to Andrew,
son of Caroly I., and grandson of Charles Martel, King
of Hungary.</p>

<p>Joanna and Andrew were married when mere children&mdash;she,
in fact, was only seven when affianced to him.
She and Andrew never liked each other, and when they
occupied one throne, dislike ripened into aversion; two
factions rent the Court with their rivalries, one favoured
by the King, the other by the Queen. At last Philippine
Cabane induced Joanna to acquiesce in a plot to murder
Andrew. One evening in September, 1345, when the
Court was at Averso, the chamberlain of the King
entered the bedroom, where were Andrew and Joanna,
and announced to him that he had despatches of importance
to communicate. Andrew rose from bed and
went into the adjoining apartment, where he was set
upon, and hung from the bars of the window with a
rope into which gold thread had been twisted by the
hands of Joanna, for as Andrew was a king, “Let him
be strangled royally,” she had said.</p>

<p>The body of Andrew was left hanging from the
window for two days. Joanna at the time was aged
eighteen, but she was utterly corrupt in mind. At
quite an early age she had had a <i>liaison</i> with the son of
<i>la Cabanaise</i>. Pope Clement VI. deemed it incumbent
on him as suzerain to order the murderers to be
punished; but only accessories suffered. Philippine was
tortured and died under torture. Her son, Robert de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Cabane, was also made to suffer in like manner; but
a wad was put in his mouth to prevent him from betraying
the part the Queen had in the murder, and
those publicly executed were also so gagged that they
might not reveal her complicity in the crime.</p>

<p>In less than two years after, on August 20th, 1347,
Joanna married Louis of Tarentum, her cousin, who had
been one of the prime investigators of the murder. But
Louis, King of Hungary, was determined to avenge the
death of his brother, and he marched an army against
Naples, under a black flag, on which was embroidered
a representation of the murder of Andrew.</p>

<p>Louis of Tarentum headed an army of Neapolitans
against the invader, but it dispersed of itself, and
Joanna fled with him to Provence in January, 1348,
leaving behind her, in heartless indifference, her son, the
child of the murdered Andrew.</p>

<p>On reaching Provence she found the barons there by
no means disposed to receive her with cordiality. The
atrocity of the crime revolted them, and for a whole
year they held her in prison. She was arraigned before
the world as an adulteress and a murderess.</p>

<p>At length, thanks to the intervention of Pope
Clement VI., she was allowed to take refuge in Avignon,
where she arranged terms with Clement, that he should
declare her innocent and sanction her marriage with her
cousin, in exchange for which favour she was to make
over to him, for a nominal sum, the city of Avignon without
the Venaissin previously acquired. The stipulated
sum was 80,000 gold florins, amounting to about £128,000
in modern money. The sale was in direct contravention
to the terms of the will of King Robert, who constituted
her heiress with the proviso that she was not to dissipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the Crown lands and rights in the Two Sicilies and in
Provence. It was further a breach of a solemn oath she
had taken to the barons “that she would never alienate
or wrong her royal and loyal estates of Provence.” But
Joanna was in need of money to prosecute the war
against Louis of Hungary. For this purpose she sold
rights and domains wherever she could find a purchaser.
She disposed of the forests of the Montagnes des
Maures to the town of Hyères, and the fishing in the
lake of Hyères as well. The rights of the Crown to the
harvest of the kermes or cochineal insect that lived on
the oaks, were also sold. Parts of the Estérel were
alienated. Marseilles and other towns bought of her
valuable privileges.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Louis of Hungary had lost much of his
army about Naples, swept off by plague. He himself
returned to Hungary, carrying with him the son of
Joanna, born two months after the death of Andrew,
deserted by her at Naples; the child, however, died
soon after. Joanna, whitewashed by the Pope, returned
to Naples in 1348, in August, whereupon Louis again
appeared in Italy at the head of an army, but met with
small success, and a truce was arranged; whereupon
Joanna returned to Avignon, there to have her guilt
or innocence formally tried before three cardinals nominated
by the Pope.</p>

<p>Louis accused Joanna of being more than accessory
to the murder of her husband, and Louis of Tarentum
of being an instigator of the crime, and Cardinal Talleyrand
Perigord as having also been in the plot.</p>

<p>Joanna appeared before the Papal Commission. She
pleaded guilty only to having disliked her husband,
and claimed that this was due to witchcraft. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
acquitted as innocent of all charges brought against her;
and as the Pope was regarded as infallible judge, in
morals as in matters of faith, the world was constrained
to acquiesce in the judgment.</p>

<p>Joanna returned to Naples, where she held a gay,
voluptuous court, frequented by the wits and artists of
Italy. Boccaccio wrote for her his filthy tales, which
he afterwards grouped together in the <i>Decameron</i>.
Petrarch corresponded with her. Leonardo da Vinci
painted her portrait; pupils of Giotto painted for her;
Troubadours sang before her, and were fulsome in their
praise.</p>

<p>But her rule was no rule at all. The country suffered
from misgovernment. Companies of adventurers ravaged
the kingdom, and carried their depredations to the very
gates of Naples. Joanna cared for none of these things;
did not give over her revelries and carnival entertainments.
Her husband Louis was offended at her shameless
gallantries, and beat her with his fists. He died in
May, 1362; and she at once offered her hand to James
of the House of Aragon, claimant to the throne of
Majorca, a young and chivalrous prince. He accepted,
and they were married in 1363; but she would not
allow him any further title than that of Duke of
Calabria.</p>

<p>He was disgusted with the frivolity of her Court, and
with her conduct, and fearing lest the same fate should
befall him that had come on her first husband Andrew,
he quitted Naples and fled to Spain. James of Aragon
died, and in 1376 Joanna married Otto of Brunswick.
This fourth marriage offended Charles of Durazzo, grandson
of John de Gravia, younger brother of Robert, King
of the Two Sicilies, who calculated on succeeding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
throne and the county of Provence should Joanna die
childless. His father Louis had been poisoned by Queen
Joanna. Now ensued the great schism.</p>

<p>For seventy years the papal court had been at Avignon,
and the Romans were sore that the money accruing from
the influx of pilgrims, litigants, and suitors to the Pope
should flow into the pockets of the Avignonese instead
of their own. Gregory IX. had come to Rome, urged
thereto by S. Catherine of Siena; and there he died in
1378. Thereupon the Romans, armed and furious, surrounded
the conclave of the Cardinals, shouting for a
Roman Pope. At the time there were in Rome sixteen
Cardinals; eleven were French, four Italian, and one
Spanish. Intimidated by the menaces of the populace,
quaking for their lives, the Cardinals elected the Archbishop
of Bari, a narrow-minded man, of low birth, coarse
manners, no tact, and, as proved eventually, of remorseless
cruelty. He showed at once of what stuff he was
made by insulting the Cardinals, and by threats of
swamping the college with Italian creations. The Cardinals
fled to Anagni, where they issued a declaration
that the election was void, as it had been made under
compulsion, and that their lives had been threatened.
However, the newly-elected Pope assumed the name of
Urban VI. As Archbishop of Bari he had been the
subject of Joanna, and she hailed his elevation, and sent
him shiploads of fruit and wines, and the more solid gift
of 20,000 florins. Her husband, Otho of Brunswick,
went to Rome to pay his personal homage. But his
reception was cold and repellent, and he retired in disgust.</p>

<p>Only four Cardinals adhered to Pope Urban. The
Cardinals at Anagni proceeded to elect Robert, Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of Geneva, to the papal throne, and he assumed the
title of Clement VII.</p>

<p>Joanna had sent a deputation to Urban, headed by
her grand chancellor, Spinelli. In public, Urban treated
the deputation with a torrent of abuse, saying that he
would eject the queen from her throne, and shut her up
in a cloister; aye, and would put in her place a man
capable of governing well. Spinelli replied that the
people were content with their legitimate sovereign;
that she was not fit for a cloister; and that if force were
used she would find arms ready to defend her.</p>

<p>Urban had thrown down the gauntlet. Joanna, furious
at the insult, at once acknowledged Clement as Pope.</p>

<p>At first the rival Popes hurled ecclesiastical thunders
at each other; each denounced his rival as Antichrist,
and each excommunicated his rival’s adherents. France,
Spain, Scotland, the Two Sicilies, acknowledged Clement;
Germany, Hungary, and England, and the major part
of Italy, recognised Urban.</p>

<p>All the fury of this latter was now turned against
Joanna, and he sent a deputation to Hungary to incite
Charles of Durazzo to take up arms against her. Charles
was not willing to do so. He knew that now Joanna
was an old woman, and most unlikely to have children,
and that in a few years inevitably the crown would fall
to him.</p>

<p>But at this juncture, Joanna made a fatal mistake.
Hearing of what the Pope had done, and supposing that
Charles would at once comply with his urgency, she
declared that she disinherited Charles, and bequeathed
all her rights to the Two Sicilies and to Provence to
Louis of Anjou, second son of King John of France.</p>

<p>Thereupon Charles hesitated no longer. He raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
an army in Hungary, and prepared to invade Neapolitan
territories. Pope Urban hired the services of a ruffian
captain of a Free Company, Alberic Barbiano, to assist.
Urban was not, however, prepared to support Charles
without getting some advantage out of him, and he
bargained with him that the Principality of Capua should
be given to his nephew, Butillo Prignano. When Charles
arrived in Rome, Urban decreed the deposition of Joanna,
and invested Charles with the sovereignty, and himself
crowned him. In the meantime Urban was busy in
forming a party in Naples against the Queen, to whom
Clement had fled. Among the twenty-six Cardinals
whom he created in one day were several Neapolitans
of the highest families and dignities in the kingdom.
He degraded the Archbishop of Naples, and appointed
in his room Bozzato, a man of influence and of powerful
connexions in the city. By this means he secured a
faction in Naples, opposed to Joanna and to her Pope.
The new Archbishop set himself at the head of the
opposition. Clement was so alarmed for his safety that
he embarked, escaped to Provence, and retreated to
Avignon.</p>

<p>The Hungarian and Papal forces marched into the
kingdom of Naples, and met with no organised resistance.
Joanna was besieged in the Castel Nuovo, and
Otho of Brunswick was captured in a sortie. Joanna in
vain awaited help from the Duke of Anjou, and was
forced by famine to surrender. She was confined in
Muro, and at first was well treated, as Charles hoped
that she would revoke her will in his favour. But when
he saw that she was resolved not to do this, he sent to
ask the King of Hungary what was to be done with her.
The answer was that the same measure was to be meted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
out to her that had been measured to Andrew; and she
was either strangled whilst at her prayers, or smothered
under a feather bed, on May 12th, 1382.</p>

<p>She was buried first at Muro, and then her body was
transferred to Naples.</p>

<p>Opinions were divided as to her character. Angelo de
Perugia qualified her as “santissima,” and spoke of her
as “l’onore del mundo, la luce dell’Italia”; Petrarch
greatly admired her; and recently, Mistral has composed
a poem in which she is painted as a blameless
and misrepresented personage. Her sister Maria was
almost as bad as herself. She also had her husband,
Robert des Baux, murdered. It is true that she had
been married to him against her will. When she got
the power in her hands she flung him into prison, and,
entering the dungeon, along with four armed men, had
him assassinated before her eyes, and the body cast out of
a window and left without burial, till Joanna heard of her
sister’s action, when she sent and had the body decently
interred.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>After that Joanna had been put to death, Marie,
natural daughter of Robert of Naples, and aunt of
Joanna, was tried and executed as having been privy
to the plot to murder Andrew. This Marie had carried
on an intrigue with Boccaccio, and is believed to be
the Fiammetta of the <i>Decameron</i>; but according to
others, Fiammetta was intended for Joanna herself.</p>

<p>The Pope’s nephew, who was to be invested with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Principality of Capua as the price of Urban’s assistance,
soon after this broke into a convent and ravished a nun
of high birth and great beauty. Complaints were made
to the Pope. He laughed it off as a venial outburst of
youth; but Butillo was forty years old. The new king’s
justice would not, however, endure the crime. A capital
sentence was passed on Butillo. Pope Urban annulled
the sentence, and Butillo was, if not rewarded, bought
off by being given a wife, the daughter of the justiciary,
and of the king’s kindred, with a dowry of 70,000 florins
a year, and a noble castle at Nocera. Thus satisfied,
Urban excommunicated Louis of Anjou, declared him
accursed, preached a crusade against him, and offered
plenary indulgence to all who should take up arms
against him.</p>

<p>The War of Inheritance ensued after the death of
Joanna, devastating alike Naples and Provence.</p>

<p>Charles of Durazzo, whom Urban had crowned, had
married his cousin Margaret, daughter of his uncle
Charles, who had been executed in 1348 by Louis of
Hungary, for having counselled the murder of his cousin
Andrew. The father of Charles had been, as already
intimated, poisoned by Joanna. Louis, King of Hungary,
died in 1382; whereupon Charles claimed that kingdom,
but was taken by Elizabeth, widow of Louis, thrown
into prison, and murdered there by her orders. Charles
left a son, Ladislas, and a daughter, Joanna. Ladislas
was poisoned in 1414, as was supposed, and then
Joanna II. became Queen of the Two Sicilies. Although
twice married, she had no family, and she adopted
Réné of Anjou and Provence as her heir, and died in
1435.</p>

<p>The whole pedigree is such a tangle, and the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
each actor in the historic drama so difficult to fix without
having a genealogical table before the eye, that I
have appended one, omitting all such entries as do not
specially concern the story. I may merely add that
Joanna’s second husband was her cousin, descended
from Philip of Tarentum, brother of her grandfather,
Robert of the Sicilies. Also, that the county of
Provence descended to Joanna I. and Joanna II.,
through their common ancestor, Charles II. of Anjou,
son of Charles I. and Beatrix, the heiress of that
county. About her I shall have something to say
later on.</p>

<p>Joanna II. was not much better as a woman than
Joanna I. She was enamoured of her handsome
seneschal, Gian Caracciolo, who did not respond to
her advances. One day she inquired of her courtiers
what animal each mainly disliked. One said a toad,
another a spider: Caracciolo declared his utter loathing
for a rat.</p>

<p>Next day, when he was on his way to his room, he
met a servant of the Queen with a cage full of rats.
As he was attempting to pass by, the domestic opened
the cage door, and out rushed the rats. Caracciolo
fled, and, trying every door in the passage, found all
locked save one, that into the Queen’s apartment. She
created him Duke of Avellino and Lord of Capua.
One day, in 1432, relying on the favour he enjoyed, he
asked to be created Prince of Capua. When she refused,
he boxed her ears. This was an outrage she
could not forgive, and by her orders he was assassinated
in his room.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Queen died two years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jeanne II.,” says Alexis de Saint Priest, “fit assoir
tous les vices sur le trône des Angevins sans la compensation
d’aucun talent, ni d’aucune vertu.” Joanna I.
had some cleverness, and in that, and in that alone, was
superior to the second Joanna.</p>

<span class="mid">L’ESTÉREL</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap08">A TRAVELLER must be very <i>blasé</i> or very obtuse
who is not spellbound by the exceptional beauty
of the Estérel. This mountain mass, like the Chaine
des Maures, is an interruption of the continuity of the
limestone of the coast. It consists of a tremendous
upheaval of red porphyry. Unlike the Maures, with its
schists and granite, the porphyry assumes the boldest
and most fantastic shapes, and the gorgeousness of its
colouring defies description. These flame-red crags
shooting out of a sea the colour of a peacock’s neck,
or out of dense woods of pine, afford pictures where
form and colouring are alike of sovereign beauty. It is
a region unique in Europe, extending something like
twelve English miles from east to west, and as much
from north to south. The medium height of its
summits is 1,500 to 1,800 feet, so that the elevation is
not great, but it is cleft by valleys that abound in scenes
of the finest order of picturesqueness. Here and there
the granite and gneiss appear; elsewhere serpentine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
trap, basalt, and blue quartzite porphyry. Beside this
is the new red sandstone and the Bunter sandstone.
Variety of soil gives variety of vegetation; plantations
of mimosa, not over a quarter of a century old, thrive
on the primitive rocks, and are mixed with cork trees,
umbrella pines, oaks, bushes of cistus, laurestinas,
myrtle, rosemary, heath, broom, and in the spring gleam
the white spears of the asphodel. It is a district in
which geologist, botanist, and artist will revel alike.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The group of the Estérel,” says Lenthéric, “differs in
form, in colour, in origin, from all the littoral mountains of
the Provençal coast. It is entirely composed of primitive
eruptive rocks; its highest summits may not reach above
1,800 feet; but all its ridges are pointed, and of a redness of
fire. The crests of the mountains are bald and savage. The
cliffs are abrupt, torn into projecting and retreating angles,
and form on the sea-face an inaccessible fortification, defended
by an archipelago of islets and reefs of almost polished
porphyry, over which the waves have broken during many
centuries without having been able to produce upon them
any appreciable marks of geological erosion. The outline,
the denticulation, the anfractuosities of the shore, the fiords
and the rocky caverns into which the sea plunges, are little
different to-day from what they were at the opening of historic
times, even, one may say, at the beginning of our own
geologic period.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="p1">This wild and wondrous region was occupied by a
Ligurian tribe of Suelteri, who have left their name,
much corrupted, to the district. The Romans found it
difficult to conquer them, but they carried the Aurelian
Road along the coast, where runs now the New
Corniche Way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>When Charles V. penetrated into Provence, with
intention to annex it, and Francis I. retreated before
him, he was so harassed by the natives of the
Estérel swooping down on his convoys and capturing
them, or cutting to pieces detached regiments, that he
set the forests on fire, and for a week or ten days flames
raged about the ruddy cliffs, making them look as
if they had been heated red hot, and either burning
the gallant defenders or driving them in desperation to
break forth from this vast raging kiln to fall on the
pikes of his men-at-arms.</p>

<p>Men, women, children, cattle, all perished in this
horrible pyre; and when the conflagration died out for
lack of fuel, nothing was left but the ashes of the burnt
forest, mixed with the calcined bones of those who had
perished in it, above which stood the gaunt red spires
of rock, like petrified flames. Such conduct provoked
reprisals, and not a soldier of the invaders was spared
who fell into the hands of the exasperated Provençals.</p>

<p>At the little village of Le Muy stood, and stands still,
a solitary tower by the side of the road, along which
the Emperor was marching. It was old and in decay,
a ruin in the midst of ruins; and so little did it excite
suspicion that the Imperialists did not trouble to
examine it.</p>

<p>But five gentlemen, witnesses of the atrocities committed
by Charles V., bound themselves to revenge
them. Accompanied by fifteen soldiers and about thirty
peasants well armed, all as devoted and intrepid as
themselves, they shut themselves into the old tower.
There each planted his arquebus in a loophole or a
crack in the walls, resolved to shoot down the Emperor
as he passed. Clouds of dust announced the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the hostile army. None of the devoted men knew
Charles by sight, but they hoped to recognize him by
the superior splendour of his armour, and the state that
surrounded him. But one of the first to go by, in
gorgeous panoply, was the Spaniard Garcia Luzzio,
mounted on a noble courser, and accompanied by picked
soldiers. Thinking that this must be the Emperor, the
Provençal gentlemen poured upon the Spaniard a hail
of bullets, and he fell from his horse, dead.</p>

<p>Such an unexpected assault staggered the soldiers of
Luzzio for a moment. But they speedily rallied and
rushed to the tower bravely to revenge the death of
their leader. The Provençals replied by a fresh discharge,
which overthrew several of the soldiers. Knowing
that they must expect death, they were resolved to
sell their lives dearly; and they were able to kill a
number of their assailants when they came on, without
order and discipline.</p>

<p>To sacrifice as few as possible, the officers ordered the
soldiers to withdraw and await the commands of the
Emperor. Charles V. came up and had cannon levelled
at the tower, and the gallant defenders either perished
in its ruins, or fell into the hands of the Imperialists,
who hung them from the trees round about.</p>

<p>In time the Estérel was again clothed in forest, and
then became the haunt of all the outlaws and gaol-birds
who had broken loose. These were organised
into a body by one Gaspard de Besse, the Robin Hood
of the district. He with his band became the terror
of Provence, waylaying merchants on the high roads,
and retreating to various caves still shown in several
places, after having plundered unfortunate travellers.
When pursuit was hottest, he escaped to the Estérel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Several murders that he had committed were the
occasion of a price being put on his head, and he was
eventually captured and broken on the wheel at Aix
in 1776. He is the hero of a charming story by
Mme. Charles Reybaud, published in 1859, but now out
of print and very scarce. A drama called <i>L’Auberge des
Adrets</i> had its scene laid in the Estérel, in 1823.</p>

<p>In 1787 the celebrated Saussure visited the Estérel
as geologist and botanist; but his enthusiasm for the
semi-tropical flora he met with in his excursions was
somewhat tempered by uneasiness about his safety. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The main road is entirely exposed, and is dominated by
salient rocks, on which the brigands plant their sentinels.
They suffer travellers to advance to some open space between
these points of vantage. Then, from their ambushes in the
woods, they swoop down on them and plunder them, whilst
the sentinels keep a good look-out, lest the guards should
come and surprise them. In the event of any of these appearing,
a whistle suffices to warn the robbers, and they dive
out of sight into the forest. It is absolutely impossible to
reach them. Not only is the undergrowth very dense, but it
is encumbered with huge blocks of stone. There are neither
by-roads nor paths; and unless one knows the intricacies of
the woods as well as do the brigands themselves, no one can
penetrate into them, except very slowly. The forest extends to
the sea, and the whole district, entirely uncultivated, is a place
of refuge for the convicts who have escaped from the galleys
of Toulon, the nursery of all the robbers of the country.”</p>

<p class="p1">Millin, who wrote in 1807, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In general it is not possible to rely on the peasants in this
region. If you ask of them your way, they will either not
answer you at all or will misdirect you. Be careful that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
nothing is wrong with your equipages, and your harness; for
no assistance is to be met with there. If they see that you
are in difficulties, they laugh; if that you are in danger, they
pass by on the other side of the way. Should a parched
traveller venture to pluck a bunch of grapes, it is well for him
if this slight indiscretion does not bring on him blows of a
cudgel, a stone, or a shot from the gun of the owner. The
cries of the peasants are those of the tiger, and like the tiger
is their vivacity and their fury. Quarrels lead to insults, and
insults are met with a blow of a stick, a stone, or the stab
of a knife, often enough mortal in its effects. He who has
committed such a crime thinks nothing of its consequences,
save how they may affect himself. He abandons his victim,
or else puts him out of the way of deposing against him. He
runs away. Watching for his prey either in the ravines of
Ollioules or in the depths of the forests of the Estérel, he waylays
the traveller. He begins as a robber, and speedily becomes
an assassin by trade. This is how the brigands are
recruited who infest the roads of Provence.”</p>

<p class="p1">Now all that is of the past. The French Tourists’
Club has made paths and roads in all directions, and
the Estérel may be traversed even more safely than
Regent Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The Estérel can be visited from Cannes or S.
Raphael, but the real centre for excursions is Agay,
an ideal nook for a winter resort. The Mornes Rougés,
a hemicycle of heights, curves about the harbour, and
cuts off every huffle of the Mistral. The Cap Dramont
intercepts the winds from the west. It possesses good
hotels, and if a visitor for the winter could tear himself
away from the gaieties of Cannes, he would spend a
month here with perfect comfort, in a warmer climate,
and with any number of delightful excursions to be
made from it. Agay and Anthéor are two settlements
of artists, and any one who enjoys sketching can follow
that pursuit in the open air in the Estérel throughout
the winter. Among the many points of interest near
Agay may be mentioned the Roman quarries of blue
porphyry, les Caous. Of these there are three. It was
for a long time supposed that the Romans transported
the greyish-blue porphyry spotted with white, found in
their structures at Fréjus and Orange from Egypt, till
these quarries were discovered. In them remain some
shafts of columns twenty-two feet long, roughed out, but
never completed. Grooves cut in the rock, and blocks
dropped on the way down to the sea, point out the fact
that the working of these quarries must have been
abandoned abruptly. There were workshops hard by,
and numerous remains of pottery and tools have been
picked up. One of the quarries was utilised for columns,
another for blocks and facing-slabs.</p>

<p>The Cap Roux, which stands forth as an advanced
sentinel, with feet in the sea, and starts up 1,360 feet,
with its red needles shooting aloft from the water, and
pierced below with caverns, is consecrated to the memory
of S. Honoratus, whose cave, La Sainte Baume, is in
the lurid cliff. Numerous pilgrims were wont to visit it
at one time, but now it is hardly frequented at all, save
by tourists. There is a fashion in saints; and poor old
Honoratus is now shouldered into the background, and
thrust into the shade. But he is not a man who should
be forgotten. His is one of the most lovable characters
in the calendar. His life was written by his kinsman
and disciple, the great Hilary of Arles, and it may
be thoroughly relied on. He is also spoken of with
much love by another pupil, S. Eucherius of Lyons.
But there exists another Life, which is a tissue of fables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and a late composition, utterly worthless, one “which,”
says Baronius, the Church historian, “cannot be read
without disgust, except by those possessed of iron
stomachs, and wits cankered with the rust of ignorance.”</p>

<p>Honoratus was son of a Romano-Gaulish nobleman,
living it is not certain where. When quite a young man
he longed to embrace a solitary life, away from the distractions
and pleasures of the corrupt society and the
degenerate civilization of the time. His father, noticing
the direction of the lad’s mind, charged his eldest son,
Venantius, a gay and impetuous youth, to turn him
from this purpose; but on the contrary, it was he who
gained his brother; and the two young men left their
home and wandered to the East. There, overcome by
the hardships of the journey, Venantius, who was
delicate, succumbed, and Honoratus buried him. Then
he set his face westward, and on reaching Provence
made the acquaintance of Leontius, Bishop of Fréjus,
and opened to him his heart. Leontius advised him to
test the sincerity of his purpose, and recommended him to
find some solitary nook in the Estérel where he might
spend time in preparation and prayer. Then Honoratus,
wandering among the forests and the flaming red rocks,
lighted on a cave on Cap Roux and made that his
place of retreat. Later, being resolute in purpose, he
departed, and, accompanied by a few others of like
mind, crossed over to the Isle of Lerins and made that
his abode. By degrees a little community formed there
about him. Honoratus, whose fine face, as Eucherius
says, was radiant with a sweet and attractive majesty,
received a multitude of disciples of all nations, who
flocked to him; and the island became the great centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of learning and holiness for Gaul. He showed the
utmost tenderness in the management of those who
committed themselves to his guidance. He sought to
penetrate to the depths of their hearts, to understand
their troubles and difficulties. He neglected no effort
to dispel every sadness, all painful recollection of the
world. He watched their sleep, their health, their
labours, that he might draw each to serve God according
to the measure of his strength. Thus he inspired
them with a love more than filial. “In him,” they said,
“we find not only a father, but an entire family, a
country, the whole world.” When he wrote to any of
those who were absent, they were wont to say, on
receiving a letter, written, according to the usage of the
time, upon tablets of wax, “He has poured back honey
into the wax, honey drawn from the inexhaustible
sweetness of his heart.”</p>

<p>The monks, who had sought happiness by renouncing
secular life, protested that they had found it on the Isle
of Lerins, under the guidance of Honoratus.</p>

<p>But every now and then, overburdened with the care
of a great community, Honoratus longed to be alone,
to rest from these engrossing cares, and to spend his
time in searching his own heart and communing with
God.</p>

<p>He had a young kinsman, Hilary by name, of whom
I have already spoken, living in the world. Honoratus
sought him out in his old home and earnestly endeavoured
to draw him to embrace the monastic life. But his persuasion
failed. Hilary stubbornly refused. Before he
left, Honoratus said, “Well, then, I will obtain from
God what you now refuse me.” And he retreated, either
to his cave in the Estérel or to his island of Lerins, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
pray for his relative. Three days after he was gone
Hilary changed his mind. “On the one hand,” he says,
I thought I saw God calling me; on the other the world
seducing me. How often did I embrace, and then
reject, will and then not will, the same thing. But in the
end, Jesus Christ triumphed in me.” And going to the
sea-coast he boated over to Lerins.</p>

<p>Honoratus was elected Bishop of Arles in 426, and
died in the arms of Hilary, who succeeded him, in 429.</p>

<p>Who thinks of this saintly old man when in the
bustling rue S. Honoré, in Paris, that is called after
him?</p>

<p>There is no need for me to describe the marvels of
rock scenery in Mal Infernet, the Ravin d’Uzel, the
Rochers du Pigeonnier, or the many other sights of the
Estérel, for there are two or three excellent little
guide-books to this most fascinating region, easily
obtainable at Cannes.</p>

<p>In addition to Agay, there are other comfortable
places well furnished with hotels, where one may spend
many pleasant days, as Théoule and Le Trayas. And
as there is not only the New Corniche Road, but also the
main line skirting the Estérel, it is easily accessible and
easily abandoned should books run short and rain fall.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">GRASSE, once a great resort, during the winter, for
visitors, has ceased to be that, unless it be out
of curiosity. They run up by train from Cannes for a
couple of hours and return by the next. The only
foreign residents there for the winter season are such as
have bought villas which they cannot dispose of. But
Grasse possesses advantages not shared by Cannes. It
is far better protected against cold winds, as it lies
under the great limestone wall that supports the bare
terrace before the Alps. But, built as it is on a steep
slope, it is not a place where any one with a weak heart
can live, unless content to live at his window. There is
scarce a bit of level street in the place. The shops are
naught and entertainments indifferent. But then&mdash;it is
an admirable centre for a stay of a few weeks, for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who desires to explore the magnificent scenery of the
Loup, the curious country in the great loop made by
the River Var, S. Vallier, and the upper waters of the
Siagne; Vence also and S. Jeannet under its marvellous
crag, full of crevasses and caves.</p>

<p>Grasse must always have been a place where men
settled, from the earliest days, as there is a <i>foux</i>, a great
outburst of purest water from the rock. The cave from
which it rushes is now closed up, and the water is led
to the place where the women wash clothes, and by
pipes is conveyed about the town. There is, however,
no evidence that the town was one in Greek or
Roman times, and it first appears in history in 1154;
but then it was a place of some consequence, and shortly
after that it contracted alliances on an equal footing with
the Pisans and the Genoese. Throughout the Middle
Ages it throve on its manufactures of soap, its leather, its
gloves, its refined oil and scents. It was a free and
independent town, governing itself like the Italian
communities, as a Republic, with its annually elected
consuls; and when it submitted in 1227 to Raymond
Berenger, Count of Provence, it made its own terms
with him. Grasse attained to great prosperity under the
celebrated seneschal Romeo de Villeneuve, a remarkable
man, whose story may here be told.</p>

<p>Douce, the heiress of the Counts of Provence, married
Raymond Berenger I., Count of Barcelona, who died in
1131. From him in direct line descended Raymond
Berenger IV., whose most trusty servant was Romeo de
Villeneuve. This man arrived at the court of the Count
as a pilgrim, staff in hand and cockleshell in hat,
coming from a visit to S. James of Compostello.
Something attractive about the man drew the attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of the Count, and he made of him his chief minister,
High Constable of Provence, and treasurer. His strict
integrity, his great prudence, and his justice, endeared
him to the people as they did to his master. Through
his instrumentality, Eleanor, the daughter of the Count,
was married to Henry III. of England, and the niece of
the Count to Richard, Duke of Cornwall. Nice had
revolted against the Count, and Romeo reduced it to
submission, and was appointed Governor of the town.
Raymond Berenger had succeeded to his Countyship
when the barons of Provence had asserted their independence
and were warring against each other and
harassing the towns. Romeo clipped their wings, and
did all in his power to favour commerce and give
prosperity to the towns. Without curtailing the
splendour of his master’s court, he took care that there
should be no extravagance there; and he gathered
about it the ablest men of the time, poets and the
learned.</p>

<p>This was the period when mortal war was being
waged between Pope Gregory IX. and the Emperor
Frederick II. The Emperor had been cursed and excommunicated,
a holy war proclaimed against him.
Gregory issued a summons to all the prelates of Europe
for a General Council to be held in the Lateran palace,
at Easter, in which he would pour out all his grievances
against Frederick, and unite the whole church in pronouncing
Anathema Maranatha against him. But the
Emperor himself had appealed to a General Council
against the Pope; one sitting in Rome, presided over
by Gregory, was not the tribunal to which he would
submit. The Count of Provence commissioned Romeo
to go to Rome with a fleet conveying bishops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cardinals to attend the Council. But Frederick had
prepared a powerful fleet in Sicily and Apulia, under
the command of his son, Enzio. Pisa joined him with
all her galleys. The Genoese and Provençal fleet met
that of the Emperor off the island of Meloria; the
heavily laden Genoese and Provençal vessels were
worsted after a sharp conflict; three galleys were sunk,
twenty-two were taken. Some of the prelates went
down in the sunken galleys; among the prisoners were
three cardinals, four archbishops, and six bishops.</p>

<p>Cardinal Otho was in the fleet, returning to Rome
with English plunder. He had been collecting enormous
sums by exactions on the clergy and freewill
offerings for the replenishing of the Papal treasury, and
the prosecution of the holy war against Frederick. All
this now fell into the hands of the Imperialists. Romeo
was not taken prisoner; he fought with determined
courage, and even captured one of the hostile vessels,
and brought it back to Marseilles.</p>

<p>Raymond Berenger died in 1245; by his will he had
confided the regency to Romeo, along with the guardianship
of his daughters.</p>

<p>Romeo assembled the Provençal nobles and the
representatives of the chief towns, and made them swear
allegiance to Beatrix, the daughter of his old master,
who had been constituted heiress of Provence.</p>

<p>Romeo succeeded in getting her married to Charles of
Anjou, brother of Louis IX. This was done with wise
purpose, but events proved&mdash;events over which Romeo
had no control&mdash;that it was a disastrous mistake.</p>

<p>In his determination to root out the Hohenstauffen
from Italy, Pope Clement IV. offered the crown of
Naples and Sicily to this Charles. This was, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Mr. Addington Symons well says, “the most pernicious
of all the evils inflicted by the papal power on Italy
and on Provence.” Then followed the French tyranny,
under which Boniface VIII. expired at Anagni;
Benedict XI. was poisoned at the instigation of Philip
le Bel, and the Papal see was transferred to Avignon.</p>

<p>Provence was henceforth involved in the bloody wars
of Italy; its wealth, its manhood, were drained away,
its Count passed to Naples to keep there his Court as a
King, to the neglect of good government at home.</p>

<p>Romeo underwent the fate of all honest and strong
men. He had made himself enemies, who accused him
to the prince of having enriched himself at the expense
of the province.</p>

<p>Romeo produced his accounts before the prince,
showing that he had not betrayed his trust to the value
of a denier; and then, resuming his pilgrim’s habit,
resumed also his wanderings. Finally he retired to the
castle of Vence, where he died. His will was dated
December 18th, 1250. Dante places him in Paradise:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Within the pearl, that now encloseth us<br />
Shines Romeo’s light, whose goodly deeds and fair<br />
Met ill receptance. But the Provençals,<br />
That were his foes, have little cause for mirth.<br />
Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong<br />
Of other’s worth. Four daughters were there born<br />
To Raymond Berenger; and every one<br />
Became a queen; and this for him did Romeo,<br />
Though of mean state, and from a foreign land,<br />
Yet envious tongues incited him to ask<br />
A reckoning of that just one, who return’d<br />
Twelve-fold to him for ten. Aged and poor<br />
He parted thence; and if the world did know<br />
The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,<br />
’Twould deem the praise it yields him, scantly dealt.”</p>
<p class="pr8 reduct">(Par. vi. 131-44).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Charles of Anjou was at all points opposite to his
brother Louis IX.&mdash;the Saint. The latter was true to
his word, just, merciful, and devoid of personal ambition.
But Charles was rapacious, cruel, and of a vehement
character. His young wife, moreover, the sister of three
queens, excited him to aspire after a crown; and he saw
in the county of Provence only a stepping-stone towards
a throne. He hoped to acquire that of Constantinople,
and he supposed that he was on his way thereto when he
listened to the summons of the Pope to dispossess
Manfred of the Sicilies. This disastrous resolve decided
the fate of Provence, and was the prime cause
of its ruin. If in the Count of Anjou there had been a
glimmer of political sense, he would have seen how
precarious a matter it was to accept a sovereignty as a
feudatory of the Holy See, and to become the sport of
circumstances ever shifting. He would have perceived
how fatal it would be to his fortunes to oscillate between
two centres; to exhaust the sources of his real strength
in Provence to maintain himself in Naples. The nobility
of Provence shared in his infatuation and eagerly joined
in the undertaking. At the accession of Charles under
the wise government of Raymond Berenger, and the
judicious husbanding of its resources by Romeo de
Villeneuve, Provence was at its acme of prosperity.
Charles brought it to ruin. After the execution of
Conradin, he rode roughshod over the people of Naples
and Sicily. To his exactions there was no end. The
great fiefs were seized and granted to Provençal or
Angevin favourites; the foreign soldiers lived at free
quarters, and treated the people with the utmost barbarity.
There ensued an iron reign of force without
justice, without law, without humanity, without mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Conradin, from the scaffold, had cast his glove among
the crowd, and called on Peter of Aragon, husband of
Constance, daughter of the noble Manfred, to avenge
him, and assume his inheritance. In Sicily, where the
exactions, the tyranny of the French were most intolerable,
a secret correspondence was kept up with Peter of
Aragon, and he was entreated to deliver the island from
its French masters. But before he was ready, an outbreak
of the populace precipitated matters. On Easter
Tuesday the inhabitants of Palermo had gone forth in
pilgrimage to a church outside the town to vespers.
French soldiers, mingling with the people, began to
assault the young women. The Sicilians, the fathers,
brothers, lovers, remonstrated, and bade the French
keep away from the festival. The French gathered
together and laid their hands on their swords. At this
juncture a beautiful girl, with her betrothed, approached
the church. A Frenchman, named Drouet, in wantonness
of insult, went up to her and thrust his hand into
her bosom. The girl fainted in her bridegroom’s arms.
A cry was raised of “Death to the Frenchmen!” and a
youth started forward and stabbed Drouet to the heart.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a general insurrection. The
cry spread to the city: every house was searched, and
every person whose dress, speech, appearance, proclaimed
him a Frenchman was massacred without
mercy. Neither old age, nor sex, nor infancy, was
spared. And in those Sicilian vespers, over two
thousand of the Provençal and Angevin nobles and
their wives perished under the knives of the justly
incensed Sicilians.</p>

<p>When Charles heard of the massacre he burst into
paroxysms of wrath. He is described as next having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sat silent, gnawing the top of his sceptre, and then
breaking forth into the most horrible vows of revenge.</p>

<p>Nor was the Pope behindhand in threats. It was
to the Pope that Naples and Sicily owed the incubus of
Charles and his Provençals. Clement IV. indeed was
dead; Martin IV. now sat in his chair; but though
there was a change in the person of the Chief Pontiff,
there was no change of mind and policy.</p>

<p>The Palermitans sent an embassy to the Pope to
deprecate his wrath, addressing him: “O Lamb of
God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy
on us!” But even this adulation could not abate his
rage. He proclaimed a crusade against the Sicilians.
Heaven was promised to those who should draw the
sword against them. Anathema was proclaimed against
all who took their side.</p>

<p>But Peter of Aragon was indifferent to this ecclesiastical
bluster, and the Sicilians were desperate. In spite
of the blessings and promises of the Pope, Charles
encountered only disaster. His fleet was destroyed, his
son, Charles of Salerno, was captured; his treasury was
exhausted, and the principal nobility of Anjou and
Provence had been decimated in the Sicilian vespers.
He sank into despondency and died, 1285.</p>

<p>Eventually, at the intercession of King Edward I. of
England, the young prince, Charles the Lame, was released.
He swore to pay 20,000 marks, and surrender
his two sons as hostages till the sum was paid, and allow
the claim to the Two Sicilies to drop. But no sooner
was he freed than Pope Nicolas IV. annulled the
treaty, released Charles of his oaths, and crowned him
with his own hands. Charles did not surrender his sons,
nor pay his ransom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“This decree of Nicolas,” says Dean Milman, “was
the most monstrous exercise of the absolving power
which had ever been advanced in the face of Christendom:
it struck at the root of all chivalrous honour, at
the faith of all treaties.”</p>

<p>But Charles was fain to content himself with his
counties of Provence and Anjou, and not allow himself
to be drawn or impelled into wars by the Pope. In
Provence he found wounds to staunch, ruins to repair.</p>

<p>It is highly to his credit that he frankly accepted this
difficult and not very brilliant part. He avoided war,
paid his father’s debts, re-established his finances, and
acquired in return the nickname of Charles the Miserly.
After a reign of twenty-four years he died in 1309.</p>

<p>Grasse had been in the diocese of Antibes, but in
1243 Pope Innocent IV. transferred the seat of the
bishop from Antibes to Grasse, on account of the unhealthiness
of the former, and its liability to be plundered
by the Moorish corsairs.</p>

<p>The bishops of Grasse were not in general men of
great mark. Perhaps the least insignificant of them
was Godeau.</p>

<p>Antoine Godeau, born at Dreux in 1605, lived in
Paris with a kinsman named Couart; and as he
thought he had the poetic <i>afflatus</i>, he composed verses
and read them to his kinsman. Couart took the lyrics
to some literary friends, and they were appreciated.
Godeau went on writing, and a little coterie was formed
for listening to his compositions; and this was the
nucleus out of which grew the Academie Française.
Couart introduced Godeau to Mlle. de Rambouillet,
and he became her devoted admirer, and a frequenter of
her social gatherings. The lady says, in one of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
letters to Voiture: “There is here a man smaller than
yourself by a cubit, and, I protest, a thousand times
more gallant.” Godeau, who entered holy orders and
became an abbé, through his devotion to Mlle. de Rambouillet,
obtained the nickname of “Julie’s Dwarf.”
Voiture was jealous of him, begrudged the favour of
the lady who dispensed the literary reputations of the
day, and he addressed a rondeau to Godeau:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Quittez l’amour, ce n’est votre métier,<br />
Faites des vers, traduisez le psautier;<br />
Votre façon d’écrire est fort jolie;<br />
Mais gardez-vous de faire folie,<br />
Ou je saurais, ma foi, vous châtier</p>
<p class="pp10">Comme un galant.”</p>

<p class="p1">Godeau lived at a time when dancers about the
saloons of the toasts and blue stockings of Paris were
rewarded with spoils from the Church; and Godeau,
when aged only thirty, was offered and accepted the
united dioceses of Grasse and Vence. He was consecrated,
and went to Grasse. Thence he wrote to
Julie:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Dans ce désert où je suis retourné,<br />
Mon cœur languit, à&nbsp;souffrir destiné,<br />
Et mon esprit plein de mélancolie<br />
Ne pense plus qu’à la belle Julie.</p>

<p class="pp6q ls1">****</p>

<p class="pp6">J’aimerai mieux être aux fers condamné<br />
Dans le dur froid de l’âpre Corilie.<br />
O Rambouillet! O nymphe si jolie,<br />
Souffrirez vous que je sois confiné</p>
<p class="pp10">Dans ce désert?”</p>

<p class="p1">However, Godeau did his duty at Grasse. Indeed,
eventually, wearied with squabbles with his chapter
there, he threw up Grasse and retained only Vence, the
poorest of all the sees in France.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Godeau was a voluminous writer, theological, historical,
and poetic; and excelled in none of these lines.
In fact, all his works have been consigned to the literary
dust heap. His appointment to Grasse had followed
on his presentation of a paraphrase of the Benedicite to
Richelieu. The Cardinal said, “Sir, you have given me
Benedicite. I in return render you Grasse (Grâce).”</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Grasse is of singularly uncouth
Gothic, of the twelfth century, with huge drums of
pillars, and the crudest of vaulting without any moulding
being afforded to the ribs. Grasse possessed
formerly a very curious feature, shared with Vence, of
having the choir for bishop and chapter in the west
gallery, over the porch. As this was so exceptional,
and as the early apse would not admit of seats for the
chapter, a late bishop built out a hideous structure
behind the high altar to accommodate himself and the
clergy. But at Vence the arrangement remains intact.
That church of Vence is of very early architecture, I
am afraid of stating how early. It consists of a nave
with double aisles on each side, and the double aisles
are carried round at the west end. Each of the aisles
on both sides of the nave is stone-floored and vaulted
underneath, forming a gallery. At the west end, both
aisles are so floored, and here, above the narthex or
porch, is the choir, with most beautifully carved stalls,
bishop’s throne at the extreme west end; and in the
middle of this odd little upstairs choir is the lectern
with its vellum MS. book of antiphons left as last used.
The date of the stalls is 1455-1460, and the lectern is
but little later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>According to tradition the church was built in the
sixth century, on the site of a Pagan temple, and an
image of an idol was buried under the foundations of
each of the pillars. What is certain is that into two of
the piers are inserted figures in alabaster from a Roman
monument, and that numerous votive tablets and
inscriptions are walled into the church. The beautiful
woodwork of the western choir escaped being blown to
splinters by a happy accident in 1596.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Feast of S. Michael, the bishop
occupied his throne at mass. When he stood up for
the Gospel, his foot broke through the floor of his stall.
He drew his foot out, and after the conclusion of the
Creed proceeded to the pulpit to preach. Whilst he
was away a choir boy looked into the hole made by
the bishop’s foot, thrust in an arm and drew out his
hand full of a black powder, which he showed to an
officer standing by, who at once recognised that this
was gunpowder. A search was made, and it was found
that enough gunpowder had been rammed in under
the throne to blow bishop and chapter up, and wreck
the church. A fuse had been inserted through a hole
bored in the woodwork, and it was supposed that the
purpose was to light this when the bishop returned
from the pulpit. A messenger was at once sent to him,
but he refused to desist from his sermon, calmly proceeding
with it to the conclusion, although the congregation,
who had received wind of the attempt, had
begun to clear out of the church. He returned to his
throne and remained there to the end of the service. It
was never ascertained by whom the plot was arranged,
whether by Huguenots, or whether it was due to private
malice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>A corner house looking out on the Cours at Grasse,
between the rue du Cours and the Passage Mirabeau,
is the old town residence of the family of Cabris. The
noblesse of the neighbourhood had their town residence
at Grasse, and there spent the winter in such gaieties as
could be got up between them.</p>

<p>In this house, No. 2 and 4 of the street, lived Louise,
Marchioness de Grasse-Cabris, the youngest and most
beautiful of the sisters of the famous Mirabeau. She
had been married when quite young to the Marquis,
who was a prey to ungovernable fits of temper, and was
considerably her senior. But there was an excuse for
his violence in the dissipated conduct of his wife.</p>

<p>The Mirabeaus were an old Provençal family which
had migrated from Florence through some of the civic
broils in the twelfth century. The patronymic was
Arrigheti, which got by degrees Frenchified into
Riquetti. The estate and title of Mirabeau were only
acquired in 1568, by Jean Riquetti, who was first consul
of Marseilles.</p>

<p>The Mirabeaus were a race of men singularly
energetic, independent, and audacious. They boasted
that they were all hewn out of one block, without joints.
They were proud, rude, with original and strongly
marked features, free-and-easy morals, and violent
tempers. Jean Antoine de Riquetti, Marquis de Mirabeau,
brigadier of infantry, was wounded in defending a
bridge in the battle of Cassans. He fell, and all the
hostile army passed over him. His old sergeant, seeing
him down, put an iron pot over his master’s head, and
fled. This pot saved Mirabeau’s life, but his right arm
was broken, and he was so damaged that he was obliged
to wear a silver collar to keep his head upright. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was presented by the Duke de Vendôme, under whom
he had fought, to Louis XIV., who received him with
some commonplace remark; to which the old crippled
soldier replied rudely, “If in quitting the Colours he
had come to Court <i>payer quelque catin</i> he would have
received more honour and less words.” Vendôme was
so scared at his audacity, that he said, “Henceforth,
Riquetti, I will present you to the enemy, and never
again to the king.”</p>

<p>The son of this man was Victor de Riquetti, who
called himself “l’Ami des Hommes,” a fantastic hodge-podge
of contradictions. He was a philanthropist and
a despot, a feudalist, but also a reformer, a professed
friend of mankind, but a tyrant in his own family. He
hated superstition, but scoffed at “la canaille philosophique.”
Separated from his wife, he was engaged in
lawsuits with her for years, which published to all
Provence the scandals of the domestic hearth of the
House of Mirabeau. The eldest son of this man was
Gabriel Honoré, the great orator, and the youngest
daughter was Louise, Marchioness de Grasse-Cabris.
The feudal castle of the Cabris is on the way to
Draguignan. Cabris occupies a conical hill in a dreary
limestone district, where the soil is so sparse that even
the olive cannot flourish there&mdash;it exists, that is all. The
place is supplied with water from cisterns that receive
the rain from the roofs. Honoré was disfigured by
smallpox at the age of three, and he retained thenceforth
an extraordinary hideousness of aspect which
struck his contemporaries, but which does not seem in
the slightest to have impeded his success with women.
His father declared that physically and morally he was
a monster. The romance of his life begins when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was aged seventeen, when, owing to a love intrigue, and
to debts, his father obtained a <i>lettre de cachet</i> and had
him imprisoned in the isle of Ré. From that time
ensued a pitiless struggle, a veritable duel, between the
imperious father and the ungovernable son. In 1772
Honoré married Emilie de Marignane at Aix; she was
a wealthy heiress, but he speedily dissipated her fortune.
His father obtained an order that he should be interned
at Manosque. But he broke bounds and came to
Grasse to visit his sister. Two days later an indecent
pasquinade appeared placarded over the walls of Grasse,
containing aspersions on the characters of the principal
ladies of rank who spent the winter there.</p>

<p>It was at once bruited abroad that Mirabeau and his
sister, Mme. de Cabris, had concocted the lampoon
between them. Mirabeau was incensed. He was too
much of a gentleman thus to defame ladies; and he
hunted out M. de Villeneuve-Mouans as the author of
this report. He went after him one day, when this old
gentleman was walking on the road bare-headed, with
an umbrella spread, horsewhipped him, and broke
the umbrella over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The consequence was that a <i>lettre de cachet</i> was taken
out against Louise; but on investigation it turned out
that it was the Marquis de Grasse-Cabris, the husband
of Louise, who was the author of the scurrilous lampoon,
and that Honoré had known nothing about it.</p>

<p>When the Revolution broke out, the Marquis fled.
The Castle of Cabris was sacked by the mob, and
Louise and her husband lived for ten years in great
poverty as <i>emigrés</i>.</p>

<p>When, finally, she returned to Provence it was to
ruined Mirabeau. The castle had been wrecked, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
she contrived to have a cottage built out of the ruins for
herself and for her husband, who had sunk into dotage.</p>

<p>The brother of the great orator and of Louise de
Cabris was André Boniface, Deputy to the Estates-General
for the nobility of Limoges. His excesses at
table, and his corpulence, procured for him the nickname
of Mirabeau Tonneau. Gabriel Honoré reprimanded
him for ascending the tribune when he was
drunk. “Why,” he replied, “you have monopolised all
the vices of the family, and have left but this one to
me.” “In any other family but ours,” he said, “I would
pass as a disgrace. In mine, I am its most respectable
member.” He emigrated to Germany. An epigram
was composed on him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“L’horreur de l’eau, l’amour du vin<br />
Le retiendront au bord du Rhin.”</p>

<p class="p1">Grasse, as already said, is an admirable centre for excursions,
and no excursion is finer than that up the Gorge
of the Loup. It is not often that commercial enterprise
adds to picturesqueness of scene; but this it has at the
entrance to the Gorge. There the railway makes a bold
sweep over a really beautiful viaduct, this itself an
addition to the scene. But further, in order to supply
electric force to Nice for its trams and lighting, a canal
has been bored in the precipice on the right bank of the
Loup, at a great elevation, to bring the water from an
upper fall, so as, by means of a turbine, to accumulate
the required power; and the falls of this stream at the
opening of the ravine are of great beauty.</p>

<p>It is hard to decide which is most beautiful, the view
of the mouth of the ravine, with the waterfall foaming
down the cliff beside it, as seen from the hill-side as the
train swings down from the direction of Nice, or whether
from the side approached from Grasse, whence up the
Gorge is obtained a glimpse of snowy peaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>There are views one sees that never leave one, that
fix themselves in the mind indelibly; and the view of
the mouth of the Loup Gorge is certainly one such
scene.</p>

<p>The ravines of the Tarn are visited by increasing
numbers of tourists every year, and I know them well;
but I do not think them superior to those of the Loup,
the Cians, and the Var. Visitors to the Riviera are for
the most part content to hug the coast and cling to the
great centres of civilization, where there are shops,
casinos, and theatres, and do not branch off afield.
Only the day before writing this page, I heard a gentleman
who had spent several winters on the Côte d’Azur
remark that “After a while one gets very sick of the
Riviera.” I promptly inquired whether he had penetrated
any of the ravines sawn in the limestone; whether
he had visited the mountain villages, such as Thouet de
Bëuil; whether he had explored the Estérel. No&mdash;he
knew nothing of them. In fact, through a dozen winters
he had seen naught save the vulgar side of Provence.</p>

<p>It does not suffice to look at the mouth of the Gorge
of the Loup. The ravine must be ascended, and that
not by the new track, cut to accommodate the lazy, high
up in the cliff, but by the footpath at the bottom. This
will lead in the first place to an exquisite subject for the
artist. On the farther bank is planted a little chapel
with a cell once tenanted by a hermit. In mid torrent
is a pile of rocks, and a light bridge of rudest construction
traverses the river; above the piles of stone in
the centre, against the purple gloom of the gorge, rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a crucifix, bathed in golden sunlight. Below, where it
can root itself, is flowering laurestinus.</p>

<p>Farther up, after a succession of magnificent scenes,
one drops upon a little house, where trout can be eaten,
lying behind a waterfall; and to assist the visitor in
reaching it, the proprietor runs out with a big umbrella
to protect him from the torrent dissolved into rain.
Further up the ravine come other and finer leaps of
water, the main stream of the Loup, in maddest gambol
of youth; and over all flash out gleams of the eternal
snows.</p>

<p>Le Bar has a painting in the church, representing a
Dance Macabre; it is, like all other such dances, of the
fifteenth century. It represents Death armed with his
bow among a party of dancers. Some are dying, and
their souls are leaving their bodies. The picture is
accompanied by a long Provençal inscription.</p>

<p>High above the entrance to the Gorge of the Loup
stands the village of Gourdon, on the limestone terrace.
The only spring water the place was supplied with
came from a fountain in a cave in the face of a sheer
precipice, reached by a thread of path, a foot to eighteen
inches wide, along the cliff, and this, moreover, interrupted
by a rift, usually crossed by a plank. But not
infrequently this plank fell, or was carried away. Then
those in quest of water leaped the gap, went on to the
cave, filled their pitchers, and returned the same way,
springing over the interval, where a false step would
entail certain death.</p>

<p>At Mouans Sartoux, between Grasse and Cannes,
stood the castle of a grim Huguenot Seigneur. The
church was under the patronage of the Chapter
of Grasse. The Sieur Reinaud invited two Calvinist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
ministers to his castle. In 1572, when the curé of
Mouans had summoned a friar to help him for Christmas
Day, and to preach, as he himself was a poor
speaker,&mdash;just after midnight the Sieur sent armed men
into the parsonage to threaten to kill the friar if he
preached next day. On Christmas morning, accordingly,
the frightened man abstained, and the congregation
had to go without instruction on the lessons of the
day. Then the Sieur broke into the church when the
parishioners were communicating, along with his men-at-arms
and his ministers, and made one of these
latter ascend the pulpit and harangue the congregation,
pour contumely on the Catholic Church, and denounce
all respect for holy seasons. The fellow further told the
people that their fathers and mothers were burning in
hell-fire for not having revolted from the Church.
Next, the Sieur renewed his threats that, should “the
<i>Cagot</i> of a friar” venture to address the parishioners in
the afternoon, he would do him to death. At vespers
he again invaded the church, and set up one of his
preachers to speak to the people. He did the same on
the two following days. The Consuls of Mouans
appealed to the Chapter of Grasse for protection, but
they were incapable of affording them effectual aid.</p>

<p>The son of this Sieur, Pompée de Grasse, was more
zealous even than his father, and did not confine himself
to threats. He placed sword-edge and firebrand at the
disposal of the Huguenot cause. He was a terror to
the whole countryside. At last, one night, when he
was at Bormes, in the Maures, a party of Catholics,
disguised in long cloaks, managed to get into his
castle, and killed him and his brother, and set fire to
the place. His widow, Susanne de Villeneuve, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
her two daughters, were allowed to escape by boat to
Hyères.</p>

<p>We are vastly mistaken if we regard the parties in
the Wars of Religion as all Lamb on one side, and all
Wolf on the other. As a matter of fact, except in the
Cevennes, the Reform was favoured only by the lesser
nobility, not out of religious conviction, but out of a
spirit of turbulence bred by the long disorders of the
English occupation of Aquitaine, and the riots of the
Free Companies. They resented the firm hand imposed
on them by the Crown, and they hoped to get
pickings out of Church estates.</p>

<p>The people generally were not touched by the negatives
of Calvinism. After that Henry IV. joined the
Church, most of the nobility and country gentry
followed his example&mdash;again, not from conviction, but
because they saw that the game of resistance was up.</p>

<p>At present, in the department of Var there are 1,500
Protestants out of a population of 310,000. In Alpes
Maritimes they number 1,000 out of nearly 294,000, and
most of these sectaries are foreign importations. If
there had been deep-rooted convictions, these would not
have been dissipated so certainly. In the Cevennes,
Calvinism holds on notwithstanding persecution in the
past, and in Ireland is a reverse instance.</p>

<p>But to return to Susanne de Villeneuve.</p>

<p>In 1592 the Duke of Savoy was at Grasse, and resolved
on chastising this Susanne as a capital influence
among the Razats. Actually two women at this period
fomented the fury and bloodshed of internecine strife.
The Baron de Vins, head of the Leaguers, had been
killed in 1589 outside Grasse. The Countess Christine
de Sault, his sister-in-law, had been the headpiece, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the arm, of the party, and it was she who, in desperate
resolve to save the Catholic cause, invited Charles
Emmanuel of Savoy to give his help against the king.
What she was on one side, that was Susanne de Villeneuve
on the other&mdash;implacable, fanatical, remorseless
in hate, and with an iron will.</p>

<p>The Duke of Savoy besieged Susanne in her castle
of Mouans, and she defended herself gallantly; but,
forced to surrender through lack of food, she imposed
as condition that the castle should be spared. The
duke broke his word, and levelled it. She was furious,
reproached him, and demanded 40,000 crowns indemnity,
or she would brand him as a liar and perjurer. He
promised the money, but departed without paying.
She hasted after him, caught him up in the plain of
Cagnes, and poured forth afresh a torrent of abuse. He
spurred his horse, so as to escape it; she flung herself
in the way, held the bridle, and used her woman’s tongue
with such effect that Charles Emmanuel was glad to disburse
the money on the spot so as to effect his escape.</p>

<p>The castle has disappeared to its foundations. The
church stands intact, unrestored.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the Hotel of the Cabris family
in the Cours. No. 1 is the ancient mansion of the
family of Théas-Thorenc, and was built by Count
François, who was engaged in the wars of Louis XV.,
and whose praises have been sung by Goethe. He was
at the taking of Frankfort, when his commander-in-chief,
the Prince of Soubise, acquired the celebrity of
the epigram:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Soubise dit, la lanterne à la main:<br />
‘J’ai beau chercher! où diable est mon armée?<br />
Elle était là&nbsp; pourtant, hier matin?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He died there August 15th, 1793.</p>

<p>Another Grasse worthy is Fragonard, the painter,
a mercer’s son, born at Grasse in 1732. He was put
as clerk to a notary in early youth, but wearied mortally
of the office, and in 1748 was given to the painter
Bucher to be trained as an artist.</p>

<p>He was in full swing of favour and success in Paris
when the Revolution broke out.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Soon events became tragic, and then began the dusk of
that bright and gentle life which had to him hitherto been one
long smile. Frago had no thought of flying from the storm,
and republicanism always remained idealised in his mind.
But sadness oppressed his heart, and his friends shared it with
him. These old pensioners of the king, enriched by the
aristocracy, could not see without regret the demolition of the
<i>ancien régime</i>, and the ruin of their protectors, emigrated,
imprisoned, hunted down. Without hating either royalty or
Jacobinism, the little group of artists of plebeian birth and
bourgeois manners suffered in silence the great revolution in
which all their past went down, as the shadows of old age
deepened on them. Their art was out of fashion. Their
piquant scenes, their dainty subjects, were no longer possible
in the midst of political and social convulsions, and a few
years sufficed to convert the respect of yesterday into the contempt
of to-day. Eighty years must pass before taste and
justice could bring men back to love the charming French
school of 1770, to understand its importance in the history of
the national genius, so as to induce the digging of its relics
forth from under the cinders of the Revolution, the empire,
and the bourgeois royalty.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="p1">A curiously small life must have been that of
these little towns under the <i>ancien régime</i>, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
time of warfare was over. It was made up of petty
quarrels, of scandals and gossip. Even in the cathedral,
the bishop and the dean and the chapter were at loggerheads
over the merest trifles&mdash;whether two or three <i>coups</i>
of the censer should be given to the bishop, whether
a bow to him should extend to the hams of the
canons. Perhaps the funniest quarrel was about the
patronage of the diocese. The bishop issued a pastoral,
in which he announced that he had constituted
S. Honoratus the patron of the clergy of Grasse, and
did not say “with the assent of the chapter.” Whereupon
the incensed chapter cut the name of Honoratus
out of their calendar, and refused to celebrate his
festival. Some of the bishops were engaged in incessant
strife. When one died, to him might be applied
the epigram written on Clement XI.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“A vermibus terræ consumendus in tumulo,<br />
A vermibus ecclesiæ jam consumptus in throno.”</p>


<p class="pbq p1">“The happy little town of Grasse,” says Lenthéric, “seems
to be the very home of flowers and perfumes. Its forests or
olives furnish the finest and sweetest oil of Provence; its
groves of oranges and lemons yield at the same time flowers
in abundance and fruit in maturity. About it are roses, jessamine,
mint, heliotrope, Parma violets, mignonette, cultivated
over wide tracts, as are also everywhere the common pot-herbs.
The transformation of these natural products into
perfumery has become the predominant industry of the district;
and the neighbourhood of the Alps allows of the
addition to this domestic flora of a thousand wild flowers and
herbs&mdash;thyme, lavender, rosemary&mdash;all to be gathered close
at hand.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">CANNES does not possess much of a history. It
was but a fishing village occupying a rock above
a little port, built about a ruined castle and a church,
when “invented” by Lord Brougham, as already related.</p>

<p>Its history may be summed up shortly. Old Cannes
possibly occupies the site of the Ligurian town of
Ægitna, destroyed <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 154 by the Consul Quintus
Opimus. The Ligurian natives had annoyed the Greek
settlers and traders on the coast, who were monopolising
their delectable seats, and the Greeks complained to
Rome of their ill-humour and rough deeds. Opimus
was sent to their aid; he subdued the natives without
much trouble, and was accorded a triumph, which meant
the leading of a train of captives in chains behind his
chariot through Rome, followed by the butchery of the
prisoners, whose carcases were thrown down the Gemonian
stairs, and drawn by hooks to the Tiber. Opimus
was notorious for his riotous living, and for his brutality.
He was as handsome as he was infamous&mdash;“<i>formosus
homo et famosus</i>.” Cicero speaks of his disreputable
life, and records a jest he made. The Romans gave
Ægitna to the citizens of Marseilles. In the tenth
century it pertained to the abbey of Lerins, and in
the Middle Ages maintained incessant contest with the
tyrannical abbots, in efforts to obtain municipal freedom.
Not till 1788&mdash;the year before the Revolution&mdash;did
the town become free from its ecclesiastical masters.</p>

<p>From Cannes in 1580 the plague spread which
ravaged Provence. It was brought there by a ship from
the Levant. To plague succeeded war. In 1746 Cannes
succumbed to the Piedmontese and German forces that
had crossed the Var. After taking and sacking Cannes,
where they got little beyond fishing-nets, they plundered
Grasse.</p>

<p>A little before this Admiral Matthews, who had taken
Ventimiglia, captured the Ile Ste. Marguerite. The war
which led to the blockading of the Ligurian coast by
the English was occasioned by a trifle.</p>

<p>In 1738 the English were thrown into a paroxysm of
indignation by a tale that circulated, which was characterised
by Burke as “The Fable of Jenkins’s Ear.”
Jenkins was master of a small trading sloop in Jamaica,
which seven years previously had been overhauled by a
Spanish coastguard boat. The captain, disappointed at
finding nothing contraband in the vessel, tore off one of
Jenkins’s ears, and bade him carry it to King George,
and inform his Britannic Majesty that if he should
come that way he would serve him in the same manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
This ear Jenkins carried about with him wrapped up in
cotton wool. For seven years Jenkins kept his ear, and
produced it in taverns and to all he met, as an instance
of the indignities to which freeborn Britons were exposed
at the hands of Spain. Of course much correspondence
took place between the two governments relative to this
bit of dried ear, but not till 1737 was he called before a
committee of the House of Commons, when he appeared
at the bar, exhibited his ear, that looked like a dried
mushroom or a truffle. War was proclaimed amidst
great rejoicing among the English. Church bells were
rung. Walpole said bitterly, “You are ringing your
bells now; before long you will be wringing your
hands.”</p>

<p>The English fleet in the Mediterranean blockaded the
ports of Spain. But the death of Charles of Austria
in the following year led to a general scramble to get
hold of portions of his vast possessions, and the war
assumed a more complicated character. The Spaniards,
assisted by the French, landed on the Italian coasts,
and Admiral Matthews was sent to drive them thence.</p>

<p>The story of Jenkins and his ear had roused all
England. Pulteney declared that England needed no
allies&mdash;that Jenkins’s story alone would raise volunteers
anywhere. It was, however, more than hinted at the
time, that Jenkins had lost his ear in the pillory, and
not through the violence of a Spanish custom-house
officer.</p>

<p>The war fizzled out. Matthews was badly served
with men and ships from England, and the Ile of Ste.
Marguerite was speedily abandoned.</p>

<p>Compared with Nice, Cannes enjoys certain advantages.
It is less towny and commercial. It does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
savour of Monte Carlo. It possesses on the east the
wooded height of La Californie, studded with hotels
and villas, commanding one of the most beautiful
evening views in Europe. When the sun goes down
beyond the Estérel range, standing up in royal purple
against an amber sky, it may well be thought that this
is a scene of unsurpassable beauty.</p>

<p>Nice has to the East Mont Boron and Mont Alban,
but they do not serve for a residential suburb, as does
La Californie. They are cut off from Nice by the port,
and they do not command so incomparable a view.</p>

<p>For the depth of winter, in gloom and cold, then
no place for shelter can be compared with Beaulieu, or
Mentone, or Alassio. But when the months of December
and January are passed, then Cannes. Lastly, to
cool off before encountering the chills of spring in
England, S. Raphael. Cannes further has at its door,
for a run of a day, Estérel, easily reached, and never to
be exhausted or forgotten. Then, again, from Cannes,
also accessible, the isles of Lerins, where the fresh
breezes blow.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Verily,” says Leuthéric, “no country in the world possesses
a climate comparable to that of Cannes. There no extremes
of temperature are known, as in other parts of Provence. The
belt of hills which enclose the gulf form a screen intervening
between the bay and the towering mountains; and when the
cold winds blow down from the Alps, they sweep over the
littoral, which lies always sheltered. Thanks to this natural
protection, they fall at some distance out to sea, and one can
mark the ruffle of the surface on the horizon, whilst that near
the beach gently undulates like the face of a tranquil lake. The
nightly loss of heat, favoured by the limpidity of a sky always
cloudless, is compensated for by the proximity of the sea, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
slow to give up its heat, and which bathes this coast with an atmosphere
ever temperate. The mean temperature is superior
to those of Nice, Genoa, Florence, Pisa, Rome, and even
of Naples; it never falls below freezing point, and never rises
as high as in most of the towns of Europe.</p>

<p>“This equilibrium of temperature is manifest in the simultaneous
development of vegetations apparently contradictory.
At Cannes, above every spot on the coast of Provence, the
vegetations of opposite climes melt into one another in an
admirable promiscuity. The landscape is veritably unique,
and one feels there as if one were transported into a vast
conservatory, in which artificially are united growths, the most
different in character. The plain is covered with oranges and
lemons, from among which shoot up at intervals the fans of
palms trees and the spikes of aloes. The hills are crowned
with umbrella pines, whose majestic heads recall classic sites
in the Roman campagna. In the background of the picture
are dark and dense forests of pines, like a gloomy drapery
above which rise the pure and gleaming heights of the Alps
in their eternal snows. Thus, as in a single framework, one
can see grouped together the great conifers of the north, the
olives of Provence, the golden fruits of the Balearic Isles, the
oleanders of Asia Minor, and the thorny vegetation of the
Algerian Tell.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">I must, however, in all fairness, add, as a qualification
to this picture, that in the early months of 1905, frost
and hail did so smite and blast the oranges, the lemons,
the eucalyptus of the plain of the Siagne, that the glory
of the glossy leaves was gone, the country had assumed
the aspect of a withered orchard. The golden fruit were
shed, and the leaves were bleached and pendant.</p>

<p>If Cannes has gone up in the world, her neighbours
have gone down. About four miles from Cannes, in the
Plain of the Siagne, is an outcrop of the Estérel red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sandstone, crowned by magnificent pines, cypresses, cork
trees and ilexes, that embower a chapel of S. Cassien
and a farm. Here, till recently, lived a hermit. These
gentry are becoming scarce. Possibly the prognostication
of M. Anselme Benoît, in Jules Fabre’s novel
<i>Mon Oncle Celestin</i>, is accomplishing itself:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Va au diable avec tes médailles et tes chapelets. Je te le
prédis depuis longtemps: à&nbsp; force d’embrasser les filles, tu
finiras par embrasser les gendarmes au detour de quelque
chemin.”</p>

<p class="p1">In 1661 Bishop Godeau found a vagabond hermit at
S. Jeanette, and tried in vain to dislodge him; but the
man hung on, and Godeau found him still there in 1667.</p>

<p>These men pick up a subsistence by the sale of sacred
medals, pictures, scapulars, rosaries; sometimes manufacturing
the latter themselves. Very often they are
simply lazy loons who can subsist on such sales and
occasional alms; but some have been as great scamps
as Jacopo Rusca in Fabre’s delightful story&mdash;which is
a graphic picture of country life and country people in
the South, full of delicious word painting.</p>

<p>Formerly S. Cassien was the fortress to the town of
Arluc. Castle and town have disappeared wholly.
Arluc, <i>Ara lucis</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as the place is called in old deeds,
was a shrine in a sacred wood. The Provençal Troubadour
Raymond Ferand tells a story of it.</p>

<p>Here lived once on a time a sorcerer named Cloaster;
he had an altar in the wood, at which he practised all
kinds of <i>diableries</i>. There was a bridge over the Siagne
crossed by the people who came there to worship.
Now S. Nazarius was abbot of Lerins. One day, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
youth named Ambrose was sacrificing to idols at Arluc,
when the devils laid hold of him, raised him in the air,
and flew away with him, in spite of all his protests and
kicks, to convey him to hell. But as they were thus
transporting him over the island of Lerins, Ambrose
heard the chanting of the monks, and he cried out to
S. Honorat to help him. Then the devils let go, and
he came fluttering down like a feather into the midst of
the cloister of Lerins, where S. Nazarius received him;
and thenceforth Ambrose lived with the monks as a
good Christian.</p>

<p>The Lerins Chronicle tells us that the Abbot Nazarius
destroyed a temple of Venus that was at Arluc, and
built a church on its site, which he dedicated to
S. Stephen in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 616, and attached to it a convent
of women. But in 730 the Saracens destroyed church
and convent and town, and sacked Lerins, where they
massacred the abbot and five hundred of his monks.</p>

<p>The town of Arluc was rebuilt by Pepin le Bref, but
in 890 the Saracens again destroyed it. It again
struggled into existence, but was finally utterly ruined
and effaced by the Tard-Venus in 1361, under their
chief, who called himself “The Enemy of Man.” These
Tard-Venus were one of the Free Companies that
ravaged the country, gleaning after others had reaped.</p>

<p>The chapel was rebuilt, and when given to the abbey
of S. Victor at Marseilles, was dedicated to S. Cassien.
The fête is on July 23rd; religious services take place
in the morning and a pleasure fair and merrymaking
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A pretty watering place is La Napoule, that once
enjoyed a prosperity of which Cannes had no thought.
It was the Roman station Ad Horea, where vast stores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of provisions were collected in magazines, for transmission
to the troops. The name Napoule has been
supposed to be the same as Naples, Neapolis, signifying
the New Town, but no text gives colour to this derivation,
and it is more probable that La Napoule comes
from Epulia, <i>Provisions</i>, as it was a store place; excavations
made there when the railway was in construction
laid bare immense underground magazines
and granaries, divided systematically into compartments
by pillars, and vaulted. These were originally well
ventilated. Remains of Roman constructions may still
be seen by the shore, and although no mention is made
in the Itinerary of Antoninus of a port there, it cannot
be doubted that there was one for the disembarkation
or embarkation of stores.</p>

<p>The little feudal castle built on Roman substructures
was wrecked by the Saracen corsairs in the thirteenth
century. The present village of Napoule is tenanted
by poor fishermen, but it is likely to look up as a
bathing place, and as a centre for excursions into the
Estérel. The tower is all that remains of a castle of the
Counts of Villeneuve. The rocks in the bay, beaten
by the sea, have assumed fantastic shapes; being of
sandstone, they are not like porphyry, too hard to resist
the erosion of the sea.</p>

<p>And La Napoule, facing east, sees how that,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“The eastern gate, all fiery red,</p>
<p class="pp6">Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,<br />
Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.”</p>
<p class="pr8"><i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, III. 2.</p>

<p class="p1">Another old place that fell into decay, but which has
in it now hopes of renovation, is Antibes. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Greek Antipolis, the town <i>over against</i> Nicæa, at the
farther side of the bay.</p>

<p>Almost all of the monuments bearing Greek inscriptions
that have been found in such numbers in
Provence belong to a date after the Roman annexation.
But this is not the case with regard to a curious inscription
discovered at Antibes on a black boulder,
egg-shaped, of diorite, a kind of basalt. This stone
had no shaping given to it by the hand of man, but
on it was cut in archaic characters, this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am Terpon, servant of the august goddess Aphrodite;
may Cypris reward with her favours those who erected me
here.”</p>

<p class="p1">What does this mean? How could the stone be
Terpon, a servant of the Goddess of Love?</p>

<p>It would seem to have been one of those mysterious
sacred stones which received worship from the most
remote ages, a form of worship belonging to the earliest
people of whom anything is known. This <i>cult</i> of rude
unshapen stones, very generally black, prevailed among
the Phœnicians; it forced its way into the worship of
the Israelites. Such stones were set up even in the
temple of Jehovah by some of the kings, who inclined
to the superstitions of the Canaanites. The worship had
so strong a hold on the Arabs that Mohammed could not
extirpate it, and the Black Stone of Mecca still receives
the veneration of the faithful. It forced its way into
the religion of the ancient Greeks, and though quite
incongruous with their mythology, held its own to the
last.</p>

<p>Prudentius, the Christian poet (died about 410) shows
us how strong was the devotion, even in his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“His first food was the sacred meal, his earliest sight the
sacred candles, and the family gods growing black with holy
oil. He saw his mother pale at her prayers before the holy
stone, and he, too, would be lifted by his nurse to kiss it in his
turn.” (<i>Cont. Symmachum.</i>)</p>

<p class="p1">It has been so tough that it is not extirpated yet.</p>

<p>In 1877 a correspondent of the Society of Anthropology
at Paris wrote about the worship as still prevailing
in the valleys of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“One comes across these sacred stones most usually near
fountains. They are rough blocks of porphyroid, or amphibolite
granite, left on the mountain side by glacial action.
They are almost invariably shapeless, and rarely present any
features that can distinguish them from other great stones
strewn about. One might pass them by unnoticed but for the
local traditions that attach to them and the veneration with
which they are regarded by the natives. In vain do the
priests preach against them. They have utterly failed to drive
the superstition from the hearts of their people. In vain do
they get them smashed up secretly, in hopes of thereby destroying
these vestiges of paganism; especially do they use
their efforts against such as serve as meeting-places to young
men and girls. The natives, when they come on the workmen
engaged in the destruction, break out into riot, and stop the
work. When they cannot do this, then they collect the fragments,
replace them, and continue to surround them with
veneration. It is necessary to disperse the <i>débris</i> of the Holy
Stone to put an end to the cult; but even then, the place
where it stood is regarded as sacred, and sometimes the clergy
plant a cross there, as the only means of turning the traditional
reverence of the spot into a new direction.”</p>

<p class="p1">Whether this religion of the black stone of Antibes
goes back to Phœnician or to Ligurian religion one cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
say&mdash;probably both Phœnician colonist and Ligurian
native shared the same devotion to rude blocks of
stone.</p>

<p>In Scotland, in Ireland, in Cornwall, in Brittany,
among the graves of the dead of the Bronze Age, almost
invariably a piece of white quartz or a jade weapon is
found. Indeed, the bit of quartz is so constant that a
workman engaged in opening one of the barrows will
cry out, “Now we are coming on the bones,” when he
sees it gleam. The bit of quartz or jade pertained to the
same category of ideas. It was the rude stone protecting
the dead, as the rude stone was the safeguard of
the living, the object of worship in life, of hope, of
confidence in death.</p>

<p>At Antibes, in the wall of the Hôtel de Ville, is the
stone with the inscription, already spoken of, to the poor
little dancing boy of twelve, from the North. In the
museum is an inscription to the memory of a horse, by
his sorrowing master. Another shows that at Antibes
there was a corporation of Utriculares, that is to say, of
boatmen who navigated the sea in vessels sustained by
bladders. These were common enough on the lagoons
and the rivers, but exceptional on the coast.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting excursion that can be
made from Cannes is to the isles of Lerins. Of these there
are two&mdash;Ste. Marguerite and S. Honorat&mdash;the latter
formerly the seat of the great school and monastery of
Lerins. The islands take their name from some mythic
Lero, of whose story nothing is known; but Pliny informs
us that there had once been a town named Vergoanum
situated on one of them which had disappeared before
the Christian era, and of which no traces remained.
That Ste. Marguerite was occupied by Greeks and
Romans is testified by the finding there of a bi-lingual
inscription. But whatever relics of structures may have
been left by its old masters have been used up again and
again from mediæval times down to the present. The
fortress now standing is a barrack. It was built by
Richelieu, considerably enlarged by the Spaniards when
they had possession of the island, and then transformed
after the plans of Vauban. The fortress was employed
mainly as a military or State prison.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">THE PRISON OF THE MAN WITH THE IRON MASK</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The most celebrated of its prisoners, or at least him
about whom most has been written, was the Man of the
Iron Mask. It was due to Voltaire that the story
obtained such currency and excited so keen an interest.
In his <i>Age of Louis XIV.</i>, published in 1751, he
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Some months after the death of Mazarin an event happened
which is without a parallel in history. Moreover, and
this is not less remarkable, the event has been passed over in
silence by every historian. There was sent with the utmost
secrecy to the castle of the Isles of Ste. Marguerite, in the Sea
of Provence, a prisoner unknown, of a stature above the
average, young, and with features of rare nobility and beauty.
On the way the prisoner wore a mask, the chin-piece of which
was furnished with springs of steel, so that he could eat without
removing it. Order had been given to kill him if he ventured
to uncover. He remained at the Isles until a trusted officer,
Saint Mars by name, Governor of Pignerol, having been appointed
in 1690 to the command of the Bastille, came to
Ste. Marguerite to fetch him, and bore him thence&mdash;always in
his mask&mdash;to the Bastille. Before his removal he was seen in
the isle by the Marquis de Louvois, who remained standing
while he spoke to him with a consideration savouring of
respect. In the Bastille the unknown was as well bestowed as
was possible in that place, and nothing that he asked for was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
refused him. He had a passion for lace and fine linen; he
amused himself with a guitar; and his table was furnished
with the best. The governor rarely sat down in his presence.
An old doctor of the Bastille, who had often attended this
interesting prisoner, said that, although he had examined his
tongue and the rest of his body, he had never seen his face.
He was admirably made, said the doctor, and his skin was of a
brownish tint. He spoke charmingly, with a voice of a deeply
impressive quality, never complaining of his lot, and never
letting it be guessed who he was. This unknown captive died
in 1703, and was buried by night in the parish of S. Paul.
What is doubly astonishing is this: that when he was sent to
Ste. Marguerite there did not disappear from Europe any personage
of note. But observe what happened within a few days
of his arrival at the isle. The governor himself laid the
prisoner’s table and then withdrew and locked the door. One
day the prisoner wrote something with a knife on a silver plate
and threw the plate out of the window towards a boat on the
shore, almost at the foot of the tower. A fisherman to whom
the boat belonged picked up the plate and carried it to the
governor, who, surprised beyond measure, asked the man:
‘Have you read what is written on this plate, and has any one
seen it in your hands?’ ‘I cannot read,’ answered the fisherman;
‘I have only just found it, and no one else has seen it.’
He was detained until the governor had made sure that he
could not read, and that no other person had seen the plate.
‘Go,’ he then said. ‘It is well for you that you cannot
read.’”</p>

<p class="p1">How Voltaire could describe the prisoner as “with
features of rare nobility and beauty,” when he was invariably
masked, so that no one could see his face, is certainly
remarkable.</p>

<p>When Voltaire found that this story had created a
sensation, he vouchsafed a solution to it. “The Iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Mask was without doubt a brother, and an elder brother,
of Louis XIV.”</p>

<p>But the mystery has been solved. We know with
certainty who the prisoner was&mdash;no one of great importance
after all, but one against whom Louis XIV. entertained
a bitter and implacable resentment&mdash;Ercole
Antonio Mattioli.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. had a strong desire to obtain the Marquisate
of Montferrat, with its capital Cassale; but the
marquisate belonged to Charles, Duke of Mantua, a
feeble, dissipated, extravagant fool. On the other hand,
the Empress and the Spanish party were bitterly hostile
to French schemes of aggrandisement. Mattioli acted
as a paid agent of the French Government to negotiate
in secrecy a sale of Cassale to Louis; and after he had
received a good deal of payment for his services, betrayed
the whole intrigue to the Austro-Spanish
Government. Louis was furious, not only at having
failed in this <i>coup d’état</i>, but also at being so fooled.
Mattioli was lured near to the frontier, and fallen on
upon Piedmontese soil, carried off and thrown into the
fortress of Pignerol, which was then in the hands of
the French. From Pignerol he was afterwards moved
to Lerins, and then finally to the Bastille, where he
died. The whole story has been thoroughly thrashed
out, and that the Man in the Iron Mask was Mattioli
and no one else has been conclusively established.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that an attempt was made to fabricate
for Napoleon a descent from the Iron Mask, who was
assumed to be an elder brother to Louis XIV., and by
this means to establish for Napoleon a legitimate right
to the throne of the Capets. But the attempt was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
absurd to obtain credence, if ever proposed to Bonaparte.
In the <i>Mémorial de Sainte Hélène</i> allusion is
made to this.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Conversation turned on the Mask of Iron, and all that
had been said on the subject by Voltaire, Dutens, etc., and
what was found in the <i>Mémoires</i> of Richelieu was passed in
review. These made him, as is well known, to be the twin
brother of Louis XIV., and his elder. Then some one (probably
Count de Las Casas) added that on studying genealogical
trees, it had been seriously shown that he, Napoleon, was the
lineal descendant of the Man in the Iron Mask, consequently
legitimate heir to Louis XIII. and to Henry IV. in preference
to Louis XIV. and his posterity. The Emperor replied that
he had, in fact, heard this, and added that human credulity
and love of the marvellous was capable of believing anything;
that it would have been quite possible to establish this to the
satisfaction of the multitude, and that there would not have
lacked men in the senate capable of producing the requisite
demonstrations, and these the men who later turned against
him when they saw that he was unfortunate.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Then we went on to discuss the particulars of the fable.
The governor of the isle of Ste. Marguerite at the time, so it
was said, the man to whose care the Iron Mask was confided,
was called M. de Bonpart, a very remarkable fact. This man
had a daughter. The young people saw each other and loved.
The Governor thereupon communicated with the Court; and
it was there decided that no great inconvenience could arise if
the unfortunate man were suffered to find in love some alleviation
of his misfortunes. Accordingly M. de Bonpart had them
married.</p>

<p class="pbq">“He who related this turned red when the facts were disputed.
He said that the marriage could be verified by inspection
of the register of a certain parish in Marseilles, which he
named. He added that the children born of this marriage
were clandestinely removed to Corsica, where the difference
of language, or deliberate purpose, caused the name Bonpart to
be rendered Bonaparte, or Buonaparte.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether it was proposed to Napoleon at one time to
circulate this fable is uncertain. What is certain is, that,
when he was emperor, he took pains to have the registers
of Ajaccio falsified or destroyed, either in preparation
for the publication of this fiction, or because they
revealed some unpleasant truths, which he was interested
in suppressing. The crucial difficulty in the way of
formulating this fable was that Saint Mars, and not any
M. Bonpart, had been governor of Ste. Marguerite whilst
the Iron Mask was there.</p>

<p>The last celebrated prisoner at Ste. Marguerite was
Marshal Bazaine, who escaped with the assistance
of his wife, it can hardly be doubted with the connivance
of the governor. Marshal François Achille
Bazaine was born at Versailles in 1811, and was destined
to be a tradesman by his very bourgeois parents. But
as he did not relish the shop, he entered the army as a
private soldier in 1831, and served in Algiers, where he
sufficiently distinguished himself to be promoted to a
lieutenancy, and then become captain of the Foreign
Legion in the service of Queen Christina against the
Carlists. In 1841 he again served in Algiers, became
colonel, and next general of brigade. He was in the
Crimean War, and returned from it as general of division.
Later he attended the unfortunate Emperor
Maximilian to Mexico, when he was raised to the rank
of marshal. There he married a rich Creole. His
conduct in Mexico was not glorious. He left the
emperor in the most menaced position; but whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
this desertion was due to himself or to orders received
from Napoleon is not known. After that, for some time
nothing was heard of him, but on the breaking out of
the war with Prussia and Germany he was appointed to
the command of the Third Army Corps. How he surrendered
Metz, with 150,000 men, on October 23rd,
1870, is well known.</p>

<p>The questions asked of the jury at his trial were
these:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pind p1">1. Is Marshal Bazaine guilty, on October 28th, 1870,
of having signed a capitulation in the open field,
at the head of his army?</p>

<p class="pind">2. Was the consequence of this capitulation, that the
army laid down its arms?</p>

<p class="pind">3. Did Marshal Bazaine, both verbally and by writing,
correspond with the enemy, without having previously
done all that was his duty?</p>

<p class="pind">4. Is Marshal Bazaine guilty, on October 28th, 1870,
of having capitulated to the enemy, and delivered
over the fortress of Metz, over which he
had command, without having previously used
every effort in his power to defend it, and exhausted
every means of holding out that lay
open to him in duty and honour?</p>

<p class="p1">The jury answered Yes, unanimously, to all these
questions, and he was sentenced to degradation and
death; but the sentence of death was commuted to
imprisonment for twenty years. On December 25th&mdash;Christmas
Day&mdash;1873, he was taken from the Trianon,
Versailles, in a close carriage, to Villeneuve l’Etang,
and thence conveyed to Antibes, where he was placed
on a steamboat and transferred to the fortress of Ste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Marguerite. On August 10th, 1874, the director of the
prison, named Marchi, found Bazaine’s prison empty.
The first thought in France, when this news was spread
by the telegraph, was that he had been allowed to
escape by the connivance of MacMahon. Then details
were published which put a romantic gloss on the
evasion.</p>

<p>In the fortress of Ste. Marguerite three rooms had been
placed at the disposal of the prisoner, as well as a little
terrace, which latter was reached by a stone bridge with
a wall on each side, and here stood a sentinel, on the
wall; but he could not see those who passed over the
bridge nor what went on upon the terrace, as the latter
was partly covered with an awning against the sun.
On the terrace, to which led several steps from the bridge,
the Marshal had formed for himself a little garden;
and whilst working therein one day he found a choked
gutter intended for carrying off rain-water from the
castle shoots; it was bored through the rock; and he
set to work to clear it. By means of sympathetic ink
he was able to maintain a correspondence with his wife;
and all was planned for his escape.</p>

<p>On the evening determined on he asked his gaoler,
who usually accompanied him for a stroll on the terrace
after dinner, to allow him to walk it alone, and this was
readily permitted.</p>

<p>After a while Bazaine opened and slammed the gate,
and the sentinel supposed that he had passed out of the
terrace garden, on his way back to the prison. But that
the Marshal, instead, had cleared the drain hole and
slipped through, he could not see, because the awning
hid from him all view of the terrace. In the drain was
a rope, and this Bazaine let down the face of the rock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
making it fast to an iron bar crossing the conduit. The
descent was for eighty feet. Below burnt a light, giving
him notice that his wife was there awaiting him in a boat.</p>

<p>The descent was not a little arduous, and he scratched
and bruised his knuckles and knees against the rock, as
a high wind was blowing at the time. When he reached
the bottom a voice across the water asked who was
there, and he struck a match and showed his face. The
boat could not come up under the cliff, and he was
obliged to plunge into the water to reach it. In the
boat were his Creole wife and his nephew, a Mexican,
Don Alvarez de Rull. Mme. Bazaine had been in
Genoa from August 3rd, and had there hired a pleasure
steam-yacht, the <i>Baron Ricasoli</i>, and in this she had
either remained in the harbour of Genoa or had gone
cruises in it, and had penetrated more than once to the
Gulf of Saint Juan. At La Croisette she and her
nephew had been set ashore, nominally that she might
look at a villa, that she pretended she had an idea of
renting. There they hired a boat, and in this they
rowed to the foot of the cliff under the foot of the
fortress, and awaited the arrival of the Marshal. No
sooner was he in the boat than they rowed to the vessel,
which had all steam up, and started at full speed for
Genoa.</p>

<p>In a letter written by Mme. Bazaine to the French
Minister of the Interior, General Chabaud-Latour, dated
August 16th, she stated that she had had no confederates.
Bazaine also made the same assertion in a letter
from Cologne. But no one believed this except the
Ultramontane editor of the <i>Univers</i>, who attributed the
happy escape to the merits of a consecrated scapular
and a thread of the Blessed Virgin’s smock, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Bazaine wore about his neck. Colonel Villette, who
had voluntarily shared the Marshal’s imprisonment,
and who quitted Ste. Marguerite the day after his escape,
was arrested at Marseilles and brought before the
magistrates. During the investigation it became clear
enough that Bazaine had not been without confederates.</p>

<p>The rope by which Bazaine had let himself down had
been woven partly out of the cord that had tied up his
boxes, partly out of a swing that his children had used,
when allowed to share his imprisonment for awhile.
Bazaine himself was not skilful enough to have made
this rope; it was woven by Villette. The iron bar to
which it was asserted that the rope had been fastened
was not to be found in the drain; and it was evident
that some one must have held the end when the
Marshal was let down.</p>

<p>Marchi, the gaoler, protested that he had only allowed
Bazaine the liberty he enjoyed, because the latter had
given his word of honour not to attempt an escape.
Bazaine’s valet, Barreau, was certainly implicated in the
matter; so was a Colonel Doineau, who, as head of the
<i>Bureaux Arabes</i> in Algeria, had been sentenced to death
for murder and robbery, but had been pardoned by
Napoleon II. He had managed the correspondence
between Bazaine and his wife. Several of the warders
were guilty at least of negligence, but were let off very
easily with one, two, or six months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>The island of S. Honorat is smaller than Ste. Marguerite.
It is a poor little stony patch in the sea, a
miniature of the larger isle, a bank of rocks covered
with a thin bed of soil, and rising not above four feet
over the sea level. And yet this isle, whose meagre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
clumps of pines and whose battered tower hardly
attract the attention of the tourists, played a considerable
part, through long centuries, in the history of
intellectual and religious growth in Europe. In 375
S. Honoratus founded there his religious community,
and grouped about him a little family of earnest and
intellectual men. In a few years it grew in power, not
the power of the sword, but of brain and earnestness of
purpose; and this island saved Western Christendom
from a grave disaster.</p>

<p>The Mussulman has a legend of Creation. According
to that, when God was creating man, He took a pellet
of clay in His left hand, moulded it into human shape,
cast it aside to the left, and said, “This goes to hell, and
what care I?” In like manner He worked another ball
of clay with His right hand, flung that aside, and said,
“And this goes to heaven, and what care I?”</p>

<p>Now the master mind of Western Christendom,
Augustine of Hippo, had devised the same theory of
caprice in the Most High, predestinating to good or ill
without reason, and that before Mohammed was born.
Divine Grace, he held, was paramount and irresistible,
carrying man to happiness or damnation without man
being able to determine his course one way or the other.
Man, according to Augustine, was a mere “Lump” of
sin, damnable, utterly damnable. But God, in His inscrutable
providence, indistinguishable from wantonness,
chose to elect some to weal, and leave the rest to woe.
This was a doctrine that did away with the necessity
of man making the smallest endeavour after righteousness,
from exercising the least self-control; of man
feeling the slightest compunction after committing the
grossest sins. Augustine sent his treatise to Abbot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Valentine of Adrumetium. Valentine, in calm self-complacency,
sitting among the ashes of dead lusts,
highly approved of this scheme of Predestination. But
a monk, Felix, when he heard it read, sprang to his
feet and uttered his protest. This protest was reported
to Augustine, who boiled over with bad temper at any
opposition; and he wrote a violent rejoinder “On Grace
and Freewill,” in which he insisted again on his
doctrine of Fatalism.</p>

<p>The theses of Augustine reached Lerins, the nursery
of the Bishops of Gaul, and were read there with
indignation and disgust. The monks drew up a reply
to Augustine that was temperate in tone and sound in
argument. Grace, they said, was mighty, but man had
freewill, and could respond to it or rebel against it.</p>

<p>Augustine answered. He attempted to browbeat
these insignificant monks and clergy on a petty islet
in the sea. But they were not men to be intimidated
by his great name and intellectual powers, not even by
his sincere piety.</p>

<p>They argued that if his doctrine were true, then farewell
for ever and a day to all teaching of Christian
morality. Man was but a cloud, blown about by the
wind, where the wind listed to carry it.</p>

<p>But for these stubborn monks of Lerins it is possible
enough that Western Christendom would have accepted
a <i>kismet</i> as fatal as that of Mohammedanism, and that,
indeed, it would have differed in name and certain outside
trimmings only from the Moslem religion. Rome
was much inclined to accept Augustine’s view, and give
it definite sanction. But the Gaulish bishops, bred in
the nursery of Lerins, would not hear of this. Finally,
in the Council of Orange, in 529, they laid down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
main principle: “We do not believe,” they boldly said,
“that God has predestined any men to be evil.”</p>

<p>S. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, was at one time a
pupil at Lerins. The “Confessions of Augustine” are
indeed a beautiful picture of the workings of a human
soul; but not more tender and beautiful than that
revelation of a noble heart given to us in the “Confession
of Patrick.”</p>

<p>Lerins&mdash;that is, especially Saint Honorat&mdash;was the
refuge of the intellect, the science, the literature, of a
civilised world going to pieces into utter wreckage.</p>

<p>As Guizot well said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“For culture of mind, one thing is requisite, and that is
quiet. When the social condition of the world is in convulsion,
and all about is barbarity and misery, then study
suffers, is neglected and declines. Taste for truth, the sentiment
for what is beautiful, are plants as delicate as they are
noble. For their cultivation a sweet atmosphere is necessary;
they bow their heads and are blighted by storm. Study,
literature, intellectual activity, could not battle against
general discouragement, universal disaster; they must have a
holdfast somewhere, attach themselves to popular convictions,
or perish. The Christian religion furnished them with the
means of living. By allying themselves to that, philosophy
and literature were saved from the ruin that menaced them.
One may say, without exaggeration, that the human mind,
proscribed, storm-tossed, found its only possible refuge in
churches and monasteries. It clung as a suppliant to the
altars, and pleaded to be allowed to live under their shelter,
and at their service, till better times should arrive, when they
would expand in the open air.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lerins suffered repeatedly and frightfully from the
Saracens. Again and again was it ravaged. In 725,
Porcarius, the abbot, and five hundred monks, were
butchered by the Moors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The interesting fortress, with its cloister and quadrangle
in the centre, was erected by the monks as a
place of refuge from the Moors and Algerine pirates.</p>

<p>But worse times were in store, when the Crown came
to look on the great abbeys as fiefs, to be given <i>in commendam</i>
to laymen, to bastards, to favourites, to harlots,
who might enjoy the revenues and ignore the duties.
Naturally enough, in such a condition of affairs, Lerins
declined. It became a place to which younger sons
were relegated, vicious monks were banished; it was
resolved into a bastille for evildoers, and sank to so low
an ebb that, as a scandal, the abbey was suppressed the
year before the Revolution came, and swept all monastic
institutions away.</p>

<p>To the west of the Île Ste. Marguerite, in the sea
pours up a copious spring of fresh water. When the
surface of the sea is calm, the upflow can be easily
distinguished by the undulations. There are other such
springs in the Gulf of Jouan, near Antibes, also at the
mouth of the Var; near the shore at Portissol, west of
S. Nazaire; another again near Bandol. In 1838, a
M. Bazin tapped this latter when sinking a well at
Cadière, and such an abundance of water poured forth
that the well had to be abandoned. Off Cassis is a
very considerable spring in the sea, so strong that it
carries floating bodies for a couple of miles from its
source. But the largest of all is in the Gulf of Spezzia,
and is called La Polla. This has been enclosed by the
Italian government, and vessels supply themselves with
fresh water from it.</p>

<p>The rain which falls on the limestone causses, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
form the terrace to the Maritime Alps, is at once
absorbed, and descends through fissures to deep
channels, where the accumulated water flows and breaks
forth in what are locally called <i>foux</i>, often in large
volume, and feed the rivers. Sometimes the streams
drop into pot-holes; these are called <i>embues</i>. The
Siagne has its source in the Place de la Caille, an
ancient lake bed, but sinks, and comes forth 1,500 feet
below in the <i>foux</i> of the Siagne. This river receives
the Siagnole, which derives its water from a number
of these springs that spout out of the rock. But in
some cases the rain-water sinks to a level still lower, and
then breaks forth in the sea itself.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NICE is a town that has uneasily shifted its seat
some three or four times. Whether it were
directly settled from Phocœa or mediately from Marseilles,
we do not know. But a Greek city it was, as its
name implies, Nike, <i>Victory</i>, speaking of a fight there,
engaged either against the Phœnicians, who resisted
their settling into quarters already appropriated, or else
against the native Ligurians.</p>

<p>Anciently, the river Paillon flowed into the tiny bay
of Lympia, but it brought down so much rubble as to
threaten to choke it, and huge embankments of stone
were built to divert the course of the river to the farther
side of the calcareous rock of the Château. These have
been discovered in the process of excavations in the
Riquier quarter. When the Greeks settled here, they
found the conditions perfect for their requirements.
The Port of Lympia then extended inland to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
is now the rue du Paillon. It was flanked on the east
by the steep heights of Mont Boron, on the west by the
crag of the Château, which latter served as acropolis
and was crowned by a temple dedicated probably to
Artemis. The site is thought to be where now stands
the chapel of the Ste. Suaire, which is square and on old
foundations. The Phocœan town lay in the lap of the
port of Lympia.</p>

<p>But when the province became Roman, then the town
occupied by the great families of consular origin, the
officials of government, and all the hangers-on, was at
Cemenelium, now Cimiez, on the high ground above
modern Nice, and dominating the ancient port. Here
had been an older Ligurian fortified town, of which
some remains exist in the huge blocks laid on one
another without cement that formed the defending wall,
and on top of which the Romans built their ramparts.
The citadel was at the extreme south point of the
plateau. In Cemenelium the principal monuments were
the palace of the governor of the province, a temple
of Diana, another of Apollo, an amphitheatre and baths.
All have been destroyed and have disappeared save the
wreckage of the amphitheatre, traversed by a road.
Roman sepulchral monuments, urns, mosaics, fragments
of marble columns, statuettes, have been unearthed in
considerable numbers. The Phocœan colonies established
on the littoral of the Maritime Alps fell into
complete decay when the Romans occupied the country,
and towards the end of the third century Nice dwindled
to almost nothing.</p>

<p>In 578 the Lombards, under the ferocious Alboin,
swept over the country and destroyed Cimiez and Nice.
The Franks drove back the Lombards into Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Cimiez remained a heap of ruins, but Nice was repeopled
and rebuilt, not, however, near the port, but on
the height of Le Château. The population of this part
of the old province revolted against the Franks; and
Nice entered into a league with Genoa and other
important towns on the Italian Riviera. In 741, however,
the province again returned under the domination
of the Franks, and it was governed by counts appointed
by the sovereign, who resided at Nice in the castle.
Here, hard by on the rock, was the cathedral, and down
the north-west slope, that was least precipitous, were
lodged the private houses. In 775 the abbey of S.
Pontius was founded by Siagrius, Bishop of Nice, and
Charlemagne, who is supposed to have been his uncle,
gave the funds for the building and endowment. This
abbey was erected on the rock on which, according to
tradition, S. Pontius had suffered martyrdom by decapitation.</p>

<p>Profiting by the break-up of the Carolingian dynasty,
in 880, Boso, whose sister was married to Charles the
Bald, seized on that part of Burgundy which is on this
side the Jura, and along with Provence constituted a
kingdom, with himself at its head.</p>

<p>In 889 the devastations committed by the Saracens
extended along the coast, and one town after another
was sacked and burnt by them. These ravages continued
till 973, when William, Count of Provence, and
Gibelin Grimaldi freed the land from this plague. The
Saracens had a fortress at Saint Hospice, a curious spur
which strikes out from the peninsula of Cap Ferrat,
whence they had harassed the neighbourhood of Nice,
but had been unable to storm the fortified town on the
rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Grimaldi destroyed the Saracen citadel, and left of
it nothing standing save the tower that remains to this
day. The captured Saracens were quartered in a
portion of Nice still called <i>lou canton dei Sarraïns</i>, and
were employed by him in strengthening or rebuilding
the walls of the town.</p>

<p>To the Saracens are attributed the subterranean
magazines, or silos, that are found at S. Hospice, S. Jean,
Trinité-Victor, and elsewhere, to contain the plunder
they acquired in their marauding expeditions. These
are vaulted over, and are still in some instances used
as cisterns or store places; but the evidence that they
were the work of the Moors is inconclusive.</p>

<p>Among those who assisted the Count of Provence
against the Saracens was one Bertrand de Balbs, and
in reward for his services he was given in fief the
barony of Beuil, a vast territory stretching from the
Estéron to the Alps, and comprising twenty-two towns
and townlets. His descendants kept the barony till
1315, when William de Balbs made himself so odious
to his vassals by his tyranny that they murdered him.
A brother of the Grimaldi of Monaco had married the
only daughter of William de Balbs, and as there was
no son the fief passed to him, and he became the
founder of the family of Grimaldi of Beuil. The barony
remained in the Grimaldi family till 1621, when it was
united to the county of Nice.</p>

<p>They ran, however, a chance of losing it in 1508.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1507, George Grimaldi, Baron
of Beuil, his son John, Augustine Grimaldi, Bishop of
Grasse, and Nicolas Grimaldi, seigneur of Antibes,
formed a plot to deliver over the county of Nice to
Louis XII. The Duke of Savoy was warned, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
summoned George and his son to appear before him.
They replied with insolence and defied him, relying on
French support. But at that moment Louis XII. and
the Duke of Savoy had arranged their little quarrel,
and when John Grimaldi asked for aid from the
Governor of Provence, he was refused. Meantime the
garrison of Nice marched against Beuil. The castle,
built on a height and surrounded by strong walls, could
have stood a long siege, when a tragic event put an end
to the struggle. The Baron de Beuil was murdered by
his valet, who cut his throat whilst shaving him.</p>

<p>The Duke of Savoy outlawed John, the son, and
gave the barony to Honoré Grimaldi, brother of George,
who had steadily refused to be drawn into the conspiracy.</p>

<p>But to return to Nice.</p>

<p>In 1229 a party in the town revolted against the
Count of Provence, and expelled those who were loyal
to him. Thereupon Romeo de Villeneuve marched on
Nice, took the town, and set to work to strengthen the
fortifications of the castle, which in future would control
it. At that time the castle consisted of a donjon, with
an enclosure that had four turrets at the angles. Outside
this Romeo built a strong wall that enclosed within
the area the cathedral and the houses of the nobility;
he cut deep fosses through the rock, and furnished the
gates with drawbridges. Later, after the invention of
powder, the fortress was further transformed in 1338.</p>

<p>After the death of Joanna I. of Naples, Nice took the
side of Charles of Durazzo, and in 1388 was besieged
by Louis II. of Anjou. The Niçois, unable without
help to hold out against him, offered the town to
Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, and he entered and took
possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The desolating wars of Charles V. and Francis I.
made a desert of Provence. Nice, as a town of the
Duke of Savoy, met with only the temporary annoyance
of the Spanish and German and Italian troops
passing through it to cross the Var. In 1538 Pope
Paul III. proposed a meeting between the two sovereigns
at Nice, and he met them there on June 18th, 1535;
a truce was concluded, to last for ten years. A cross of
marble marks the spot where the conference took place.
It was thrown down in 1793, in the Revolutionary
period, but was again set up some twenty years later.</p>

<p>Paul III., in proposing the meeting of the two rival
monarchs, had not only an eye to the welfare of the
people of Italy, harassed by incessant and desolating
war, but also to the interest of his own family. He
had been elected Pope in 1534, and at once created
Alexander, child of one of his illegitimate sons, Cardinal
at the age of fourteen, Archbishop of Anagni when
the boy was only fifteen, and Archbishop of Mont Real
and Patriarch of Jerusalem when aged sixteen. Another
grandson, Ranncio, he created Archbishop of Naples
when aged fourteen, and Archbishop of Ravenna at
the age of nineteen. Now, when meeting the two
sovereigns, he negotiated with Francis to have his
granddaughter united to a prince of the house of
Valois; but Francis procrastinated, and the marriage
did not take place. He was more successful in marrying
his grandson Octavio to Margaret of Austria,
natural daughter of Charles V.</p>

<p>But that Paul did use his utmost endeavours to
obtain a truce of ten years is shown by the testimony
of the Venetian ambassador who was present at Nice
on the occasion of the meeting. He could find no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
words sufficiently strong in which to eulogise the zeal
and patience displayed by the Pope on this occasion.</p>

<p>Paul, however, never lost sight of the advantage
of his family. At the time of the Conference he
succeeded in getting Novara from the Emperor, for his
illegitimate son, Pier Luigi, for whom he had already
alienated Parma, and raised it into a Duchy, at the
expense of the States of the Church.</p>

<p>The implacable jealousy entertained against one
another by the two monarchs led to the war breaking
out again; Francis I. entered into alliance with the
Turks under Barbarossa, and a combined army laid
siege to Nice in August, 1543. The Turkish cannons
completely destroyed the Convent of Ste. Croix, in
which Pope Paul had lodged in 1538, and broke down
large portions of the city ramparts. It was then that
occurred an incident that has never been forgotten in
Nice. Catherine Ségurane, commonly called Malfacia
(the misshapen), a washerwoman, was carrying provisions
on the wall to some of the defenders, when she
saw that the Turks had put up a scaling ladder, and
that a captain was leading the party, and had reached
the parapet. She rushed at him, beat him on the head
with her washing-bat, and thrust down the ladder, which
fell with all those on it. Then, hastening to the nearest
group of Niçois soldiery, she told them what she had
done, and they, electrified by her example, threw open a
postern, made a sortie, and drove the Turks back to the
shore. According to one version of the story, Catherine
gripped the standard in the hand of the Turk, wrenched
it from him, and with the butt end thrust him back.</p>

<p>The story first appears in a “Discours sur l’ancien
monastère des religieuses de Nice,” 1608. Honoré<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Pastorelli, the author, merely says that a standard of
the Turks was taken from the ensign by a citizeness
named Donna Maufaccia, who fought at the Tour des
Caïres, where were the Turkish batteries. A second
authority, in 1654, Antonio Fighier, says that the event
took place on the Feast of Our Lady in August; that
the woman seized the staff of the standard and flung it
into the moat.</p>

<p>Some weeks later the Turks penetrated into the
town and carried off 2,500 prisoners to their galleys;
but these were retaken by the Sicilian fleet.</p>

<p>The war between Charles V. and Francis I. was
terminated by the Treaty of Crépy in 1544. By it the
House of Savoy recovered all the places in the Duchy
taken by the French. Duke Charles III. ordered the
complete restoration and remodelling of the defences of
the town and castle. In the wars of Louis XIV., Nice
was attacked again and again, and in 1706 was taken by
the Duke of Berwick. By order of Louis, the castle
was then completely destroyed by gunpowder. Thus
disappeared this noble fortress after twenty centuries of
existence; and now of it almost nothing remains. By
the peace of Utrecht in 1713, Nice was restored to
Savoy. In 1748 Charles Emanuel of Savoy had the
port of Lympia cleared out and made serviceable. It
had been choked up for some centuries. It was not till
1860 that the county of Nice was definitely annexed to
France. Hitherto the Var had been the boundary between
Italy and France, now the delimitation is the
Torrent of S. Louis. The natural demarcation is unquestionably
the <i>col</i> of La Turbie and the Tête du
Chien, and Monaco, about which more presently.
I have given but a meagre sketch of the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Nice; but the reader would have no patience with all
the petty troubles&mdash;great to those who endured them&mdash;which
afflicted Nice and its vicinity through many
centuries. Now it enjoys peace, and thrives, not only as
a city, doing a large business, but also as a vestibule to
Monte Carlo. The cathedral, that once stood near the
castle on the rock, was demolished in 1656, and the present
building&mdash;a rococo construction in the barbaric
taste of that period&mdash;was erected below the rocky height.
On December 16th, the Bishop Désiré de Palletier was
contemplating the dome that was in process of construction,
when some of the material fell on his head and
killed him. In 1705, on March 16th, a bomb fell in the
cathedral and exploded, killing many people. If it had
blown the whole church to atoms it would have caused
no loss to art.</p>

<p>Curiously enough an accident happened of a somewhat
similar character to the church of the Port. The
design for this monstrosity was sent by a Turin architect.
The cupola was to be of wood, covered with lead.
But the clerk of the works, in carrying out the design,
substituted stone for wood. The result was that, one
Sunday morning, just after the consecration of the
church, the cupola fell in. Happily it was during the
first mass. The priest at the altar, hearing a cracking
above him, bolted into the vestry. An old woman, who
was the sole assistant, fled into the porch, and no lives
were lost when the whole structure collapsed.</p>

<p>Nice has produced some men of note&mdash;as Masséna,
“L’enfant chéri de la victoire”&mdash;whose real name was
Menasseh; he was the son of a petty Jewish taverner, and
was born in 1756. What a simmering cauldron that was
in Europe, which brought to the surface Bernadotte, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
saddler’s son! Murat issued from a little public house.
Augereau, the child of a domestic servant; Masséna, the
Hebrew waif and stray. Masséna was gifted by nature
with a powerful frame of body, and with indomitable resolution.
He was considered the most skilful tactician
among Napoleon’s generals, and on the field of battle
he was remarkable for coolness. He had, moreover, the
invaluable quality in a commander of not being dispirited
through defeat. His faults were primarily
rapacity and avarice. In Italy, when commanding the
French army of occupation, he “behaved in such a
way,” as Miot de Melito informs us, “that the French
troops, left without pay in the midst of the immense
riches which he appropriated to himself, revolted, and
refused to recognise his authority. His pilferings, his
shameless avidity, tarnished the laurels with which he
had covered himself.” He brought down on himself
repeatedly the censure of Napoleon. But the greed was
born in the bone. He could not keep his fingers off
what was of money value, and might be turned into
coin.</p>

<p>When Bonaparte assumed the command in Italy, he
employed Masséna actively on all occasions of importance,
and so justly appreciated the brilliancy and military
talents he possessed, that he surnamed him “the
favoured child of victory.” In 1798 he was appointed
to the command of the army, which under General
Berthier was to occupy Rome and the Papal States.
His appointment was as distasteful to the soldiers as to
the inhabitants of the subjected country, for they both
became victims of his insatiable avarice, and the multiplied
complaints made of his peculations at last forced
him to resign the command and to return to Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Whilst Masséna was in Rome stuffing his pockets,
a paper was affixed to the statue of Pasquin, with this
dialogue inscribed on it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“What is the time of day, Pasquin?”<br />
<i>Pasquin</i>: “The time of thieves.”</p>

<p class="p1">Although Masséna had exposed his person in so
many battles without receiving a wound, he had the
misfortune to lose an eye whilst in a sporting party,
some shot having accidentally struck it.</p>

<p>That which redounded most to the fame of Masséna
was his gallant defence of Genoa, in 1800, after the
garrison had been reduced to eat their boots. The defence
had made the Austrian army lose valuable time,
and afforded Bonaparte the requisite time to collect
sufficient forces to cross the Alps and crush the
Austrians at Marengo. After that decisive day, the
first Consul who desired to return to France, remitted
the command of the troops to Masséna; but only for
a while. A certain feeling of hostility reigned between
the Republican General and the future Emperor.
Masséna was envious of the fame of Napoleon, and resented
the distance that separated him from an old
comrade in arms. After the <i>coup d’état</i> of the
18th Brumaire, he was admitted to the legislative corps,
and voted against granting the consulate for life to
Napoleon, and persistently sided with the opposition;&mdash;not
out of principle, for of that Masséna did not possess
a particle, but because he was jealous of Napoleon’s
greatness and increasing power.</p>

<p>However, Napoleon could not afford to overlook him
when conferring honours, and Masséna was content to
accept these, along with the money granted him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
maintain his honours. He was created Duke of Rivoli
and Prince of Esslingen. But he was not grateful, and
of all the marshals of France he showed himself most
eager to rally to the Restoration and to recognise
Louis XVIII. He had sufficient keenness to see that
Napoleon’s star was in decline, and all that he really
was solicitous for was to keep hold of his hoarded
treasures. He died at Ruel, his country seat near Paris,
in 1817.</p>

<p>This upstart family still flourishes on the accumulated
plunder, and still retains the titles of Duke of Rivoli
and Prince of Esslingen, but is no longer of the
Jewish persuasion.</p>

<p>The great square at Nice is called after Masséna, but
another square bears a far more reputable name&mdash;that
of Garibaldi, who was also a native of Nice, born there
on July 4th, 1807.</p>

<p>General Marceau’s ashes rested for some years at
Nice. He fell near Coblenz in 1796, and his body was
burnt and transported, as he had desired, to Nice, to lie
beside the body of his sister Emma, when it should
be her time to depart this life. She died at the age
of eighty-one in 1834, and was laid beside the ashes
of her brother. Marceau had never been shown the
smallest token of love by his mother, and he had been
brought up by his sister, to whom he was devotedly
attached. His last words were: “Je ne regrette qu’elle.
Je lui dois ce que je puis valoir.”</p>

<p>It is a pity that his wishes were so far disregarded
that in 1889 his remains were disinterred and transferred
to the Panthéon, at Paris.</p>

<p>Nice has produced a poet, the Jasmin of this part of
Provence; his name is Rancher, and he was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
1785, on July 20th, two months before due; he was so
small that a bon-bon box was extemporised as his
cradle. Indeed, it was supposed that he was dead, and
he was to have been carried to burial in his bon-bon
box, when his father, who was a surgeon, stooping over
him, heard a faint sigh, and preparations for the funeral
were stopped. He became secretary to the Count de
Cessola, president of the Senate of Nice, and then
under-secretary of the Tribunal of Commerce, an office
he retained till his death in 1843. He wrote songs and
composed music to them, also a little vaudeville, and a
poem “La Nemaïda,” which was serio-comic, and turned
on a local incident, a dispute between the beadles and
sacristans of the church of Ste. Françoise de Paule.
His little vaudeville led to his imprisonment. It had
been composed for performance before King Charles
Felix and his queen, Marie Christine, when they were
at Nice at Christmas, 1829. He ventured without
authorisation to introduce on the stage his nephew,
aged nine, dressed as a peasant, and to set him to play
a little piece on the violin. This had not been submitted
to the proper authority and allowed; accordingly the
Count de Faverger, Governor of Nice, ordered the
incarceration of the audacious poet. But this bit of
red-tapism was too much, and Rancher was released
in a couple of hours. He revenged himself on the
governor by a satirical and burlesque song, that ran
like wildfire through the town. A street in Nice bears
Rancher’s name.</p>

<p>Nice was the scene of the sacrilegious rascalities of a
rogue, Collet, whose story, as he operated at Fréjus and
at Draguignan as well as at Nice, may be told.</p>

<p>Collet was born at Belley, in the department of Aine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of worthy and pious parents. He entered the army
after having gone through a course of studies, and
became sub-lieutenant in 1796, and was at the siege
of Brescia. But, disgusted with military service, he
deserted and went to Rome. Whilst there he heard
of the wreck of a merchant vessel off Civita Vecchia
under a young captain named Tolosant, of Lyons, with
the loss of all hands. At once he saw his chance. He
forged papers, got a ring cut with the Tolosant arms,
and passed himself off as the captain, who had escaped.
By this means he deceived a worthy priest, who was
steward to Cardinal Fesch; and as the Cardinal was
acquainted with the family of Tolosant, he introduced
the <i>soi-disant</i> captain to him. The Cardinal at once
insisted on Collet taking up his abode with him, and he
even presented him to the Pope, who gave the rascal his
apostolic benediction. As a friend of Cardinal Fesch,
Napoleon’s kinsman, and an inmate of his house, Collet
made the round of the bankers of Rome, discussed
with them schemes for making money, and drew loans
from them to the amount of 60,000 francs. Then Collet
was invested with a charge to perform some ecclesiastical
commissions in Lombardy. He left&mdash;disappeared&mdash;just
as suspicions began to be entertained that he was not
what he pretended to be, and turned up at Mondovi.
There he gave himself out to be a gentleman of means,
and he speedily ingratiated himself into the society of
the young bloods there. As Mondovi was a dull town,
he proposed to brisk it up by the institution of a theatre
and by amateur performances. This proposition was
cordially accepted, a committee was appointed, and
Collet was named costumier; he was to purchase a
complete theatrical wardrobe. All who were to act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
were required to pay for their own costumes, and the
money was put into Collet’s hands to furnish these.</p>

<p>All at once the costumier vanished, carrying off with
him all the dresses, those of clergy, bishops, generals, civic
authorities, with ribbons and crosses of various orders.</p>

<p>He next turned up at Sion, in the Vallais, now in the
cassock of a priest, and furnished with fictitious letters
of Orders. There he presented himself to the bishop,
and so ingratiated himself into his favour that the bishop
nominated him to one of his best cures, which happened
to fall vacant. He was instituted, and for five months
said mass, preached, married, baptized, catechised the
children, and consoled the dying.</p>

<p>Now the church was in a dilapidated condition, and
the late rector had begun a collection for its rebuilding.
Collet called together the committee of the building
project, and learned that the sum already collected was
30,000 francs. He at once volunteered to contribute
50,000 francs to the fund, if he were made treasurer,
and suffered to build on to the new church a chapel in
which his own mortal remains might repose after his
death; for never, never, oh never, would he leave his dear
parishioners! A ready consent was given, and the
sum collected was put into his hands. An architect was
engaged, designs for the new church were procured, the
old building was pulled down, the material sold, and the
sum produced by the sale was lodged in the hands of
Collet. Then he suggested that the mayor and the
architect should accompany him to Sion to buy the
ornaments and paintings requisite for the new church.
Accordingly they departed in a carriage. Chalice,
tabernacle, three marble altars, candelabra, were bought,
but not paid for. At the recommendation of Collet, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
mayor returned to the village, carrying with him the
purchases; and the architect departed to engage masons
and carpenters.</p>

<p>No sooner was Collet left than he took post-horses
and departed for Strasburg. There he vanished. His
next appearance was in Italy, shifting his quarters and
changing his costume repeatedly. At Savona, on the
Riviera, he persuaded a banker to let him have 10,000
francs. Next he appeared at Nice, in a shovel hat, a
purple cassock, and wearing a gold pectoral cross, as
Dominic Pasqualini, Bishop of Manfredonia. He called
on the Bishop of Nice, showed him the bull of his
institution, forged by himself, and so completely deceived
him, that the bishop offered him the most cordial
welcome, showed him hospitality, took him into the
seminary and asked him to examine the seminarists.
Collet saw the risk he ran, and evaded it shrewdly.
“Monseignore,” said he, “I can see by the look of their
faces that they are a set of asses. I do not wish to
hurt their feelings by exposing their ignorance&mdash;I being
a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Bishop of Nice, “if you will
not examine them, you shall ordain them; there are
thirty-three to receive deacon’s and sub-deacon’s orders
next Sunday.”</p>

<p>Collet could not refuse. Accordingly, vested in full
pontificals, in the Cathedral of Nice, he committed this
sacrilegious act.</p>

<p>After this, not seeing his way to making much money
at Nice, he departed, changed his costume, and appeared
at Fréjus as plenipotentiary of the Emperor, an inspector-general,
charged with seeing to the equipment
of the army of Catalonia. He presented his credentials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
which seemed to be in order; he took a high hand, and
required the head of the Gensdarmerie to furnish him
with a mounted escort to Draguignan, and he sent on an
orderly before him to announce his purpose in visiting
the town, requiring proper lodgings and provisions to be
furnished for him. Then he appeared at Draguignan,
with breast covered with Orders, and there he formed
his staff. A retired captain became his aide-de-camp;
the son of the Sub-Prefect of Toulon he graciously
received as his secretary; he named two officers of
artillery, one as paymaster, the other as his steward;
and finally, with a staff of twenty persons, he went to
Marseilles, where he so imposed upon the authorities
that he was allowed to draw 130,000 francs from the
government treasury. Thence he went to Montpellier,
and there his star began to pale. One day, after having
reviewed the troops, he dined with the Préfet, to whom
he had promised the cordon of Grand Officer of the
Legion of Honour, when, during the meal, the hôtel of
the préfeture was surrounded by gensdarmes, a party of
police entered the dining-room, and the Organiser of the
Army of Catalonia was arrested and led to gaol. All
his staff shared his fate, but were released after an imprisonment
of twenty days.</p>

<p>One day the Préfet was giving a dinner party, and, to
amuse his guests, offered to produce the prisoner who
had so befooled him and the rest of the good people of
Montpellier. Accordingly he sent to the gaol for Collet,
who expected every moment to be brought forth and
shot. Three gensdarmes conducted Collet from prison
to the préfeture, and till the guests were ready to see
him he was thrust into an ante-room, and two gensdarmes
were posted at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Collet’s quick eye detected, lying in a corner, the
white cap and apron of a cook, and a dish of caramel on
the table. In the twinkling of an eye he had dressed
himself as a cook, taken up the dish, kicked at the door,
till the gensdarmes opened and allowed him to pass
forth between them; they supposing him to be the cook.</p>

<p>Collet slipped out of the house and concealed himself
next door. A hue and cry ensued, and the alarm bell
rang; the gensdarmes galloped along the roads about
Montpellier, and Collet looked on complacently from
the window, till, after fifteen days, the search for him
was relaxed, and then he left the town.</p>

<p>After having rambled about for a while without leaving
traces of his presence, he reappeared in the department
of Tarn, where he presented himself before the superior
of the Schools of Christian Brothers, and informed him
that he was a gentleman of private means and of a
devout turn of soul, and that it was his desire to found
a novitiate for the Brothers, and that he had a sum of
40,000 francs at his disposal for that purpose. Then he
visited a M. Lajus, a Toulouse merchant, and entered
into negotiation with him for the sale of a house he had,
and he informed him that he was ex-sub-prefect of the
department of Aine. M. Lajus accompanied him to
the house, and allowed Collet to order and see to the
carrying out of alterations, the pulling down of walls,
etc., under his eye&mdash;before a sou had been paid of the
stipulated price. Then Collet returned to the mother
house of the Christian Brothers and urged the director
to visit the new novitiate. The worthy man was so
delighted that he gave a holiday to all the inmates of
the establishment, that they might go together to inspect
the fresh acquisition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“But,” said the reverend superior, “who is to look
after the house whilst we are away?”</p>

<p>“Have no concern about that,” said Collet. “I will
keep guard.”</p>

<p>So all these green goslings trotted off on a visit of
inspection, to decide which room was to be fitted up as
a chapel, which was to be library, which were to be
devoted to studies, and which to serve as dormitories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Collet had free range over the college.
He broke open the treasury of the society and filled
his pockets with the money found there. He visited
the chapel, and carried off all the sacred vessels; he
cleared out all the desks and lockers, and left behind,
as the superior afterwards said, “nothing but my spectacles,
to enable me another time to look sharper after
rogues.”</p>

<p>Collet departed, with all his spoil, and took the road
to Anjou; he next turned up at Bessac in a hotel, where,
through vague hints thrown out, he allowed it to be supposed
that he was the Emperor Napoleon, escaped from
Ste. Helena, and in hiding&mdash;awaiting his opportunity to
reascend the imperial throne. The loyal Bonapartists
called on him and were graciously received, and they
offered him money which he also graciously accepted
and promised to repay with usury and with honours
when he came to his own again. At last the mayor
became alarmed, called on him, and respectfully intimated
that he himself was in danger of being called to
account for harbouring in the place the illustrious fugitive;
that personally he was devoted to his imperial master,
and that for this very reason he was solicitous for his
welfare. He feared that the secret of his presence at
Bessac was divulged, and it was quite possible that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
attempt would be made to assassinate the fugitive. He
accordingly strongly urged Collet to remove to a place
where he was not in such danger.</p>

<p>Collet accordingly departed; went to Rochebeaucourt,
where he took up his lodging with the commissary of
the police.</p>

<p>In the meantime accurate descriptions of Collet had
been sent throughout France to the police, and this
commissary had received them. Yet never for a moment
did it occur to him that the gentleman of aristocratic
appearance and with a purse well lined, who paid so
promptly and liberally for his <i>pension</i>, could be the man
so much sought for.</p>

<p>From Rochebeaucourt Collet went to Le Mans, where
he figured as a well-to-do bourgeois, devoted to charitable
actions; a man of irreproachable life. But there, finally,
he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to twenty years’
hard labour, and to be branded as a felon. In prison he
remained for twenty years, and died on the eve of the
day when his chains were to be struck off, in November,
1840.</p>

<p>This extraordinary story does not so much prove how
gullible men are, as how good and trustworthy most
men are, so that when we do come across a rogue who
takes advantage of us, it is like an earthquake that shakes
us out of our moral equilibrium.</p>

<p>Some very interesting excursions may be made from
Nice to places accessible by electric tram or by train.</p>

<p>Cagnes was a castle of the Grimaldi. The little town
occupies a hog’sback, the summit of the hill is crowned
by the château, and the one street leading to it runs up
the spine of hill, with houses on each side clinging to
the steep sides. The castle is not very picturesque, but
it has in the midst a quaint court, surrounded by galleries
and stairs. The great <i>salle</i> had its ceiling painted by
Carlone in the seventeenth century. It represents the
fall of Phaeton, and is one of those subjects in the
debased style of the period that are <i>tours de force</i> in
perspective. It represents an arcade of Corinthian pillars
with windows between them painted on the flat surface,
seen in perspective from a single point only. The castle
was occupied by the Allies in 1815; a Piedmontese
garrison was placed in it, and the soldiers amused themselves
with firing at the head of Phaeton.</p>

<p>The painter spent three years over this absurd work,
and when leaving it complete he wept and said, “Bella
mea cascata di Phaëton, io non piu te vedere, mai, mai,
mai!” It is really not worth looking at, save as an
example of the degradation of art. The castle no
longer appertains to the Grimaldi; it has been sold.</p>

<p>Eze is reached by tram, passing the beautiful bay of
Villefranche, to the foot of the precipice on which it
stands, and from whence it is reached by a scramble
up a zig-zag path in about an hour. It is a curious
example of a town, built on the summit of a rock,
walled about, once with its castle planted in its midst,
where it might, it was hoped, be safe from Moorish and
Algerine pirates. Once an important place, with its
consuls, it has sunk to ruin, and is now occupied by only
ninety people. The church was built in 1772. The castle
is levelled to the foundations, but the town walls remain.</p>

<p>In 1770 the Corniche Road did not exist. David the
Painter was on his way to Italy to study at Rome. He
arrived at Eze at night, and the curé very kindly took in
the poor and footsore young artist. He was interested
in David, and gave him a letter of introduction to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
kinsman, the Prior Fighera, in Rome. This opened to
David many doors in the capital of Western Christendom,
and David received orders for pictures. In gratitude
he sent a painting of S. John the Baptist to his
friend, the curé of Eze, for his new church. About the
year 1880 this picture vanished. The Administration
des Beaux Arts instituted an inquiry, and ascertained
that the Consuls of Eze had sold the painting to an
Englishman for 500 francs, whereas it was worth
100,000 francs. That picture is now in the National
Gallery.</p>

<p>In the little cemetery of Eze is laid a Swiss woman,
assassinated in 1902 by Vidal, a woman-murderer.
From Nice a line takes to Puget Théniers, on the Var.
The line is full of interest, passing places rich in striking
objects, and allowing of branch excursions up the
Vesubie, the Timée, the Cians, with scenery of the
grandest character. It, moreover, enables the visitor
to explore strange villages, such as Touët-de-Beuil,
plastered against the limestone rocks. The <i>Clus</i> of the
Cians at Touët, where the river cleaves through the Jura
limestone stained various colours, is as fine as anything
of the kind. There is hardly a village or town accessible
from this line that does not repay a visit, and which
will not fill a sketch-book or furnish a photographer
with subjects.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">MONACO is assuredly the loveliest spot on the
entire Ligurian coast. More the pity that it
should be delivered over to such evil associations as
cling to it.</p>

<p>Monaco itself is a limestone crag rising out of the
sea, linked to the mainland by a neck, the rocks on all
sides precipitous, but cut into, to form an approach to
the town. Above it towers the ridge that extends from
the Mont Agel, with its fortress gleaming white against
a gentian-blue sky, by La Turbie, “hunc usque Italia,
abhinc Gallia,” and the Tête-de-Chien, formerly Testa-de-Camp.</p>

<p>The rock of Monaco takes its name from Monoikos.
It was dedicated to the Phœnician Melkarth, the One
god in a house, who would suffer no other idols in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
temple, and that temple anciently crowned the rock.
The adoption by the Grimaldi of a monk as supporter
to the arms is due to a misapprehension that Monaco is
derived from Monacus. Unhappily, matchlessly beautiful
as is the situation, the buildings of Monaco do not
conduce to picturesqueness. The palace is mean and
ugly to the last degree. It has four towers, erected in
1215 by the Genoese architect Fulco del Castello, but
the domestic buildings connecting these towers are of
various dates, and all bad. The palace has not a single
bold and characteristic feature to give it dignity.</p>

<p>A vast sum&mdash;from the gambling tables&mdash;has been
spent upon a cathedral, designed by Charles Lenormand.
Internally, and indeed externally, from near at hand it
is fine and dignified. But from a distance it produces
an unpleasing effect. It has no tall towers, no stately
dome; but at the rear, a monstrous hump, designed to
make a display of the West front, otherwise meaningless.
The distant effect of this church is that of an infant
peacock, spreading its tail before it has any feathers
to display.</p>

<p>There is not a single commanding feature in the
bunch of buildings huddled together on the summit of
the rock, and old Mentone, with its commonplace
church tower, presents a nobler aspect than does Monaco.
No finer site in the world could be found, and none has
been so wasted through incapacity to utilise it.</p>

<p>Monaco is an independent principality, under an
autocratic government. It, its prince, its gambling hell,
are under the protection of France. The principality
comprises 5,436 acres, which would be the estate of
a petty English squire. But the Sovereign has his
Council of State, his nobles, and his bishop at command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Also an army, consisting of five officers and seventy
men. Formerly there was a guard of honour in addition,
whose function it was to blow trumpets and present
arms when the Prince entered or left the main gate
of the palace. But this guard of honour was dissolved,
February 1st, 1904, and the soldiers of the standing
army now perform the duties formerly devolving on the
guard. The dissolution of the corps must have resembled
the famous dismissal by Bombastes Furioso:
“Begone, brave army, and don’t kick up a row!”</p>

<p>The six bronze cannon in front of the palace were
given by Louis XV. Each has its name, and they bear
the inscription: “Ultima ratio regum.”</p>

<p>The Grimaldi were a Genoese family, and they first
appear in history as assisting William, Count of Provence,
and the Emperor Otho I., in expelling the Saracens.
For their services, the Emperor conferred Monaco
on one of them, others were rewarded with fiefs, near
Nice, and in the Maures, as already told.</p>

<p>A claim is made to descent from Grimoald Mayor of
the palace, who died 656, but it is baseless, and rests on
no better foundation than identity of name; for patronymics
were not then in use.</p>

<p>The descendants of Gibelin Grimaldi, possessors of
the fief of Monaco, were at first only seigneurs, but
eventually became sovereigns, and the family obtained
large tracts of land, and acquired great power in Provence
and Liguria. Till the seventeenth century they
had a flotilla of galleys destined to stop all coasters and
exact a toll. This fleet also served in the wars in which
the neighbouring states were involved.</p>

<p>Rainier II., Prince of Monaco, in 1302, entered the
service of Philip the Fair, and was the first to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a Genoese fleet in 1304 through the Straits of Gibraltar
into the ocean. He conducted sixteen galleys to the
coast of Flanders, and encountered the Flemish fleet
before Ziricksee. He concerned himself little about the
French vessels that had joined him, and allowed all of
them to be taken; but as the Flemings were felicitating
themselves on their victory, he returned with the rising
tide, pierced their line, destroyed a number of their
ships, and took prisoner Guy de Namur, son of the
Count of Flanders.</p>

<p>Charles II. of Monaco was made governor of Provence
and admiral of the fleet of Genoa. In 1338 he directed
twenty galleys against the Flemings; in 1346, along
with Antonio Doria, he led thirty against the English.
The troops were disembarked, and joined the French
army which encountered the English at Creçy. The
Genoese were esteemed the best archers in the world.
Grimaldi and Doria disposed them to the best advantage,
and they would have done great execution in the
English ranks, but that the rain had relaxed the strings
of their bows, and, says Froissart:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“They hooted, advancing with their crossbows presented,
and began to shoot. The English archers then advanced one
step, and shot their arrows with such force and speed that it
was like a fall of snow. When the Genoese felt the arrows
that pierced their arms, heads, and though their armour, some
of them cut the strings of their crossbows, others flung them
on the ground, and all turned and retreated in discomfiture.
The French had a large body of men-at-arms on horseback,
richly dressed, to support the Genoese. The King of France,
seeing them fall back, cried out: ‘Kill me those scoundrels, for
they block our way unreasonably!’ Then you would have
seen the French men-at-arms lay about them, killing all they
could of those runaways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Grimaldi fell there, mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Antonio Grimaldi, Genoese Admiral in 1332, was
charged to revenge the ravages of the Aragonese on the
coasts of Liguria, at a time when civil war prevented
the Genoese from defending themselves and their possessions.
Grimaldi, with a fleet of fifty-five vessels, harried
the coasts of Catalonia, leaving behind him only ruins,
and loading his vessels with plunder and captives. He
carried off the galleys of the enemy from the harbour of
Majorca. The Aragonese sent against him a fleet of
twenty-four vessels, but he defeated it. In 1353 he was
again placed at the head of the Genoese naval forces,
and again sent against the Aragonese, who were now in
league with the Venetians. Grimaldi had a fleet of
fifty-two sail, and he hoped to fight and defeat the
enemy before they could effect a junction. In this he
was disappointed. He met the combined fleets near an
islet off the north coast of Sardinia, August 29th, 1353.
Pisani, the admiral of the Venetians, concealed a portion
of his fleet, and Grimaldi, deceived, attacked the rest.
Whilst thus engaged, he saw the detached portion of the
Venetian flotilla approach, and he found that he had to
deal with seventy-three sail. To present a strong front to
the enemy, he bound his galleys together by the sides and
masts, reserving only four on each wing to act as reserve.
The Venetians and Catalans seeing this arrangement,
also united their vessels to the number of fifty-four, but
kept sixteen free at their flanks. This singular disposition
shows how little, if at all, naval manœuvres had
altered since the time of the civil war between Cæsar
and Pompey.</p>

<p>The Catalans brought up three round tubs of vessels
called <i>coques</i> against the right wing of Grimaldi, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sank as many of his galleys. Alarmed at this, he
unlinked eleven of his vessels and rallied them to the
eight of the reserve, and, without striking another blow,
fled, and left the rest of the fleet a prey to the enemy.
All the thirty vessels thus abandoned by the cowardly
admiral were obliged to surrender.</p>

<p>In that day the Genoese lost 3,000 men killed, and
3,500 taken prisoners. The Republic had never before
suffered such a disaster. Despair took possession of
government and people, and they abdicated their independence
and proclaimed John Visconti, Duke of Milan,
as Lord of Genoa. Lucien (1506-14) murdered his
brother John, so as to obtain the principality for himself&mdash;at
least, so it was surmised, and Lucien was obliged to
fly from Monaco on that account, and conceal himself,
till Duke Charles of Savoy gave him an indult, forbidding
all inquiry to be made into the matter of the crime,
and search after the murderer. Then Lucien stole back
to Monaco and assumed the sovereignty. His sister
Francesca had married Lucas Doria, and when left a
widow, by her will constituted her brothers Lucien and
Augustine, who was bishop of Grasse, guardians of
her children. After her death her son Bartholomew
Doria complained bitterly that his uncle Lucien Grimaldi
kept hold of the inheritance and would not surrender
it. At last, resentment induced him to resolve on revenging
himself on Lucien, for the wrong done to himself,
and for the murder of his uncle John. He secured
the promise of co-operation, if required, of the famous
admiral, Andrew Doria, and he sent to Monaco some
confederates, with a request to Lucien to let them be
lodged there in safety, as they had got into a broil at
Genoa. He also intimated his intention to follow shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and halt at Monaco on his way to Lyons, where he
hoped to have an interview with the King of France,
and to obtain from him a charge in his army.</p>

<p>When Bartholomew arrived at Monaco, Lucien invited
him to breakfast and gave to his nephew the
place of honour at the table. Bartholomew could not
eat, and when pressed to do so by his uncle complained
that he had lost his appetite. Lucien then
placed one of his children on Doria’s knee; but the
young man trembled so that the child had to be taken
from him. On rising from table Bartholomew asked the
prince to give him some instructions as to his course.</p>

<p>At this time Andrew Doria’s fleet put into the harbour
of Monaco, and the admiral sent to Bartholomew
a laconic epistle, “What thou hast to do, do quickly.”
Lucien bade his nephew accompany him into a cabinet at
the end of the gallery. As the prince entered, the major-domo
came up and informed him that Andrew Doria’s
galleys had arrived in the port, and handed to Bartholomew
the sealed letter bidding him be speedy in executing
what he had undertaken.</p>

<p>When the major-domo withdrew, none were in the
cabinet save the prince, who seated himself, a black
slave, and Bartholomew, who stood by the window. All
at once the tramp of feet sounded in the gallery, and an
assassin rushed in, followed by others holding daggers
and shouting, “Ammaza! kill! kill!” In a few minutes
Lucien was despatched, and then the murderers,
surrounding Bartholomew, marched forth, descended to
the port, and were received on board the galley of
Andrew Doria.</p>

<p>Hercules I. (1589-1604) met with a violent death from
some of his own subjects. He used his sovereign power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to get possession of and outrage the wives and daughters
of his subjects. At last some, whose wives had been
dishonoured by him, conspired, took him and flung him
over the rocks into the sea.</p>

<p>Louis (1662-1701), Prince of Monaco, became enamoured
of the celebrated Hortense Mancini, Duchess
of Mazarin, exiled from France for her intrigues. He
followed her to Rome, and thence to London, where he
and Charles II. were rivals for her favour. Saint
Evremond did all in his power to separate her from the
prince and constitute her a prime favourite of the King,
in place of the Duchess of Portsmouth. A rivalry in
prodigality ensued between little Monaco and the King
of Great Britain. It was the fable of the frog and the
ox enacted. In an access of jealousy Charles withdrew
a pension of £4,000 he had accorded to the duchess,
whereupon Louis sent her an order for that same
amount, payable for life out of his treasury, accompanying
it with a copy of verses. That the money was
paid regularly is more than doubtful.</p>

<p>This Louis was married to Charlotte de Gramont,
who was one of “<i>les grandes amoureuses</i>” of the reign of
Louis XIV. She intrigued with the king. She entertained
a passion for her ambitious cousin de Lauzun.
Her many love adventures furnished Saint Simon with
a good deal of not very edifying matter for his
Mémoires. Whilst Charlotte revelled in Paris, Louis
sulked at Monaco. As news reached him of Charlotte
having made a fresh conquest, he had a gibbet erected
on the confines of his tiny principality, and the happy
man in effigy hung from it; and as Charlotte’s caprices
and conquests were numerous, the frontier of Monaco
was soon marked out at intervals by a score of gallows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
from which dangled dummy men, all dressed in Court
costume.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Not merely,” says Mme. de Sévigné, “is this measure
retrospective, but folk amuse themselves by informing the
prince of what is now going on. The consequence is that the
gibbets have to be put closer together, and more than half
of the courtiers are now dangling in effigy along the frontiers
of Monaco. I can assure you that I have had many a laugh
over this, and others as well. The king himself laughs at it.
This frenzy of hangings passes all belief.”</p>

<p class="p1">At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the
Spaniards had profited by the minority of Honoré II. to
put a garrison into Monaco, under the pretext of alliance.
Speedily they took advantage of this to behave as
masters of the place. Prince Honoré, to escape from their
domination, signed a secret treaty with Louis XIII. in
1641, by virtue of which his sovereign independence was
guaranteed and a garrison of 500 French soldiers was
assured him after the expulsion of the Spaniards. But it
was precisely this last thing that was most difficult to
achieve. Honoré succeeded by subtlety. He ordered
the arrest of thirty of the inhabitants of Monaco, lusty
men, and cast them into prison; then invited the
Spanish garrison to a grand banquet at the palace,
and made them as drunk as fiddlers. When they were
almost incapable of defence, he opened the prison, told
the men he had locked up that they were to massacre
the Spanish garrison, and put daggers into their hands.
The Spaniards, however, were not so drunk that they
could not defend their lives; they were, however, nearly
all slaughtered; and the gates were thrown open to
some French soldiers who had been waiting at Antibes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to replace the Spaniards. This took place in November,
1641. In consequence of this, all the estates of Honoré
in Italy were confiscated, but Louis XIII. indemnified
Honoré for this by granting to him the Seigneurie of
Les Baux in Provence and the Duchy of Valentinois.</p>

<p>Antoine, who died in 1731, was the last direct male of
the house. He left a daughter, Louise Hippolyte, who
married Jacques François de Matignon, Comte de
Torrigny. She survived her father but eleven months.
Her son Honoré III. (1731-1795) lived at the time of
the outbreak of the French Revolution. The new ideas
excited effervescence in little Monaco, Roquebrune, and
Mentone, which belonged at the time to the principality,
and they demanded elective councils. Honoré was compelled
to yield, whereupon the Councils suppressed all
feudal rights. Then, when he was frightened and ran
away, the three towns declared the House of Grimaldi
deposed. Nice had been united to France, and Monaco
demanded the same favour, which was granted February
14th, 1793. Honoré was arrested on September 28th,
in the same year, and detained till Thermidor 9th.
He died in 1795. By the treaty of Paris, 1814, Monaco
was restored to Honoré IV., his son, but on the return
of Napoleon from Elba, the principality was occupied by
an English force. By the treaty of November 20th,
1815, it was transferred to Sardinia; but this lasted only
till 1816, when Honoré V. regained his principality.
His son Florestan I. (1841-56) abolished monopoly in
bread, allowed free trade, and founded a college at
Mentone. The revolution of 1848 was disastrous to the
Prince. Mentone and Roquebrune severed their connexion
with Monaco and were annexed to Sardinia.
Charles III. (1856-89) succeeded his father, Florestan.
He it was who conceived the idea of repairing his losses
by the establishment of gaming tables at Monaco.</p>

<p>The princes had coined gold, silver, and copper money
from 1505, with the legend, “Christus regnat, Christus
imperat, Christus vincit.” This legend became inappropriate
thenceforth, in Monaco.</p>

<p>In 1856 Charles III. started the gambling tables in a
building adjoining the palace, afterwards occupied by
the guard of honour. But the venture was not a
success. Monaco was out of the way, hardly accessible
from the land, where the Corniche Road ran high above,
on the summit of the cliffs by La Turbie, so that it
could be reached conveniently only by sea.</p>

<p>The gambling concession passed through various
hands, till, owing to the closing of the Casino at
Homburg, M. Blanc thought of Monaco. In 1863 he
went there, on March 31st, entered the bureau of the then
concessioners, Lefebre and Co., and said, “You want to
sell this affair; I am disposed to take it. Reflect. I shall
return here at 3.30 p.m. I leave at 4 p.m. by the steamboat,
and I want to have this matter settled before I go
back to Nice.” The company sold it to Blanc for
1,700,000 francs.</p>

<p>On April 1st, All Fools’ Day, 1863, Blanc formed La
Société anonyme des Bains de Mer et Cercle des
Étrangers à Monaco, for fifty years, with a capital of
fifteen millions, represented by 30,000 shares of 500
francs each. One of the first to take shares in this
gambling society was Pope Leo XIII., at the time only
cardinal. Blanc was a little man, with moustache
already white, aged fifty-seven, when he came to feather
his nest, and that of the Prince of Monaco, at Monte
Carlo. He married his daughter to Prince Roland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Bonaparte, grandson of Lucien, Prince of Caninio, the
brother of the Emperor Napoleon I.</p>

<p>Blanc died in 1881. In 1882 it was resolved to
double the capital of this “bathing establishment.” The
fifteen million was raised to thirty million, divided up
into 60,000 shares of 500 francs each, Blanc’s heirs
retaining about 52,000 shares in their own hands. As
the original concession was for fifty years, and would
expire in 1913, it was deemed advisable to approach the
Prince of Monaco for an extension, and this was
granted, as the shareholders complained, “on very hard
terms.” It was signed on January 16th, 1898, and by
this agreement the company received a fresh concession
for fifty years.</p>

<p>So profitable an affair is this Circle des Étrangers and
Société des Bains de Mer, that the ordinary 500-franc
shares rose at once to 4,770 francs.</p>

<p>An old Italian proverb was to this effect:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">Monaco io sono</p>
<p class="pp7">Un scoglio.</p>
<p class="pp6">Del mio non ho<br />
Quello d’altrui non taglio</p>
<p class="pp7">Pur viver voglio.</p>

<p class="pn1">That may be rendered, “I am Monaco, a mere rock;
I have naught of my own, I take no goods of others;
yet I must live.”</p>

<p>This proverb is now as inappropriate as the legend
on the coins; for Monaco lives and thrives on the
plunder of those who go there to empty their money on
the tables.</p>

<p>Les Spélunges, a rocky promontory, full of holes and
cracks, like a petrified sponge, on which formerly
shepherds pastured their goats, has become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
world-famed Monte Carlo; and La Condamine, once
the flower-garden that supplied the House of Rimmel
with perfumes, is now occupied by houses of those who
live more or less directly on the tables. Charles III.,
who made the concession, has not left a very savoury
recollection behind him. Whilst his father was reigning
prince, he tired of being only heir apparent, and stirred
up a revolt against his father; but the National Guard
arrested him, and he was conducted to Genoa, where he
was set at liberty.</p>

<p>His son, Albert Honoré Charles, the present Prince,
married Lady Mary Victoria, daughter of the Duke of
Hamilton and Brandon, on September 21st, 1869, and
by her had a son, born in 1870.</p>

<p>But they apparently got tired of each other, for the
Pope was approached by Lady Mary, with the full consent
of the Prince, to get the marriage annulled.</p>

<p>Now the Church of Rome holds very strict views
as to the indissoluble nature of marriage. Even the
successor of S. Peter protests his inability to pronounce
a divorce. <i>But</i>, he can annul a marriage on various
grounds; and to help this out, all sorts of bars to legitimate
marriage have been devised, as consanguinity
within seven degrees of relationship, affinity, spiritual
relationship through sponsorship at the font, or legal
relationship through guardianship, beside many others,
by means of some of which, with a little greasing of
palms, hardly a legitimate union cannot be annulled.
Accordingly, on January 3rd, 1880, after eleven years
of married life, the Pope declared the marriage to have
been void, on the plea put forward by Lady Mary that
she had been over-persuaded to marry the Prince, by her
mother. But the Papal Court laid down that although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the connexion had been one of mere concubinage, yet,
nevertheless, the son was to be regarded as legitimate.
“Which is the humour of it,” as Corporal Nym would
say. It further ordered that the re-marriage of either
party must take place where the State did not require
civil marriage, as civil courts considered the first marriage
as valid. “Which,” again as Nym would say, “is
the humour of it.”</p>

<p>Eleven months after this decree Lady Mary Hamilton
married Count Tassilo Festitics, at Pesth; and the Prince
married, October 30th, 1889, Alice, dowager duchess of
Richelieu, a Heine of New Orleans. The name is
Jewish.</p>

<p>The Pope seems to have felt that his proceeding in
this matter had made the sensitive consciences of Roman
Catholics wince, for he shortly after issued an Encyclical
on Marriage, and pointed out what were the pleas
on which the Papal Court was justified in dissolving
existing marriages. The <i>Tablet</i> also, on March 31st,
1894, published an apologetic article, in which it assured
the world that the official fees paid to the Propaganda
for annulling a marriage were trifling, that, in a word,
a marriage could be dissolved at Rome, dirt-cheap, for
£120. More shame to it, if true. But “Credat Judæus
Apelles non ego.”</p>

<p>This Court, as we know, will allow, for a handsome
consideration, an uncle to marry his niece, whereas
formally it forbids an union within the seven degrees.</p>

<p>High aloft, towering above Monaco, 1,270 feet from
the sea-level, accessible by a cog-railway, is La Turbie,
the point where the old Roman Via Aurelia and the
modern Corniche Road cross a neck that is the natural
division between France and Italy; the point where, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Roman times before the Empire, Gaul ended, and Italy
began.</p>

<p>La Turbie is a corruption of Tropaïa&mdash;the Trophy,
for here stood the monument erected by Augustus about
the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 13, commemorative of his victories over
the Ligurian natives of the coast. For some seventeen
years the empire had existed. All exterior marks of
flattery and submission had been accorded to him. To
him had already been given an official worship, as if he
were a god. Even that “white soul” Virgil thus speaks
of the living emperor:&mdash;“A god has vouchsafed us this
tranquillity; for to me he (Augustus) shall always be
a god. A tender lamb from our folds shall often dye
his altar with its blood.”</p>

<p>Ancient writers have left us no description of the
monument. Pliny records the inscription it bore in
seventy-eight words, of which thirty-three were devoted
to the official dedication to the divine Augustus and to
record his dignities, and forty-five to the enumeration of
the conquered peoples.</p>

<p>The monument has gone through a period of sad
wreckage. The Genoese pillaged it of marbles wherewith
to decorate the palaces of the citizen nobles; and
in the period of the furious struggles between Guelfs
and Ghibellines it was converted into a fortress. It now
presents a substructure of the period of Augustus, above
which rises the shattered fragment of a mediæval tower.</p>

<p>Before the year 1869 only fourteen letters of the
inscription had been recovered. Since then five more
have been found, which had been built into a wall surrounding
the village. From a description of the monument
as it existed in the sixteenth century, before it was
such a complete wreck as it is at present, written by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Franciscan, Antonio Boyer, of Nice, it had a square
basement about twenty-four feet high, above which rose
a circular structure sixty feet high, divided into two
stages, with marble columns ranging one above another.
Between these columns were niches once adorned with
statues, and the whole was capped by a cupola surmounted,
probably by a statue of Victory, or of Augustus.
In the basement were two doors, and above the
north door was the tablet inscribed with the dedication
to Augustus. The upper portion, converted into a
tower in the Middle Ages, was destroyed in 1705 by
order of Louis XIV. Mines of gunpowder were exploded
under it.</p>

<p>The church, erected in 1777, and the houses of La
Turbie are built out of the stones pillaged from this
monument. In the church is a copy of the S. Michael
of Raphael, given by the Musée S. Germain in exchange
for a statue and the fragments of the inscription, from
the Trophy of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It is worth while to sit on the
rock and look at this ruin&mdash;the ruin of an immense
monument set up to honour a mortal deified, and to
whom sacrifices were offered, who gathered into his own
hands all the authority and power of the known world
for his own selfish glorification&mdash;and think, that at the
same time He was born who made Himself of no reputation
and took on Him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of man&mdash;who humbled Himself
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross. The Trophy of Augustus is a heap of ruins, but
the Catholic Church, the trophy of Him who was born
under Cæsar Augustus, is everywhere, and imperishable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Sitting on the honeycombed limestone rock, looking
on that wreckage, and hearing the bells of all the church
towers for miles around break out in musical call to the
Angelus, this thought rises and fills the mind: Selfishness
has but its day; self-sacrifice establishes an everlasting
reign.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo occupies, as already said, a limestone
headland, forming the horn of the bay opposite Monaco,
but not projecting to anything like its extent into the
sea. Between the two is the ravine through which a little
stream decants into the harbour. Here is the Church of
Ste. Devota.</p>

<p>Devota was a girl brought up from childhood in the
Christian faith. When she was quite young she was
taken into the house of Eutyches, a senator, and probably
a relation. Eutyches was not a Christian, but he
was a kindly disposed man, and loathed the idea of persecution.
On the publication of the edict of Diocletian
in 303 against Christians, he sacrificed along with other
senators; but the governor of Corsica, where he lived,
hearing that he harboured in his house a little Christian
maiden, had her brought forth and ordered that she should
be executed. Her feet were tied together, and she was
dragged over rough ground till she was cut and bruised
through her entire body. Then she was stretched on the
rack, and expired. According to the legend, as she died
a white dove was seen fluttering over her; it expanded
its pure wings, and, soaring, was lost in the deep blue of
the sky. The following night a priest rescued the body,
placed spices about it, laid it in a boat, and bade a boatman
named Gratian carry it away. Then the white dove
appeared again, skimming over the water; and so Gratian,
following the bird, rowed till he reached Monaco, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
there the body was laid. Her festival is on January 27th,
and on that day a procession leaves the cathedral at
Monaco and descends to the Church of Ste. Devota in
the gulley.</p>

<p>The great charm of Monte Carlo consists in the
gardens with tropical plants. As to the buildings of
Casino and Theatre, they are by Charles Garnier, who
was also the architect of the Grand Opera House at Paris,&mdash;enough
to say that they are vulgar and display no
token of genius and sense of beauty. They are appropriate
to a gambling hell. That is all that can be
said of them.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The Casino,” says Miss Dempster, the authoress of <i>Vera</i>,
“is the thing that all Europe, Asia, and America talk of, that
all moralists decry, and that all pleasure-seekers declare to be
a paradise. It is the Casino that gives wealth and fashion to
this section of the coast. It is the Casino that causes a dozen
trains to stop daily at Monte Carlo; that keeps up the palace,
the army, the roads, the opera-house, and the Hôtel de Paris.
It is the green table that keeps the gardens green and the
violins in tune; that has brought 3,000 residents and so many
hundred prostitutes to the town; that gives work to 1,000
servants, and causes the annual issue of about 335,000 tickets.
When we consider these facts, the fabulous beauty of the site,
the mildness of the climate, the good dinners, the better music,
the pigeon-shooting, and the many exciting chances, can we
wonder that Monte Carlo is in every mouth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>It is just the fact that the site is so exquisitely beautiful
that is the pity of it all. Why should the moral
cesspool of Europe be precisely there? How much
better were it in the Maremma or the Campagna, where
the risk to health and life would add zest to the speculation
with gold. As long as men people the globe there
will be gambling, and it is in vain to think of stopping
it. All the lowest types of humanity, the Lazaroni, the
North American Indians, the half-caste Peruvians and
Mexicans, resort to it with passion, and the unintellectual
and those without mental culture throughout Europe
will naturally pursue it as a form of excitement. It is
therefore just as well that there should be places provided
for these individuals of low mental and moral calibre to
enjoy themselves in the only way that suits them, but
again, the pity is that one of the fairest spots of Europe,
this earthly paradise, should be given over to harlots
and thieves, and Jew moneylenders, to rogues and fools
of every description. The entire principality lives on the
tables, the prince, the bishop, the canons, the soldiery,
the police, the hotel-keepers, those who have villas,
the cabdrivers, the waiters, the boatmen, all are bound
together by a common interest&mdash;the plunder of such
as come to Monte Carlo to lose their money. The
institution must be kept going, every scandal must be
hushed up. If a case of suicide occur, in ten minutes
every trace disappears, and no public notice is given
of what has occurred. It is against the interest of every
one connected with the place, with Nice also and
Mentone, to allow such an event to transpire.</p>

<p>If any trust may be reposed in the assertions of
Captain Weihe, a German naval artillery officer who
has resided at Monte Carlo for three seasons, the cases
are far more numerous than is supposed. According to
him, directly a man has shot or hung himself, he is
whisked away by the police and the body concealed till
it is ascertained that no one is particularly interested in
his fate. Then, at the end of the season, the bodies of
the suicides are packed in cases that are weighted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the boatmen sink them far out at sea between Monte
Carlo and Corsica.</p>

<p>According to the same authority, the bodies were
formerly thrust into the holes and cracks in the limestone
on which the Casino and the tributary buildings
of Monte Carlo stand, but the condition in consequence
became so insanitary that the place had to be cleared of
them, and a large body of workmen was imported from
Italy and employed on this work, and the corpses removed
were disposed of at sea. Captain Weihe asserts
as a matter of his own knowledge or observation that
from the upper part of the rift of Pont Larousse, in
1898, sixty corpses, from the lower by Villa Eden ten
or twelve were removed.</p>

<p>The game of roulette is composed of two distinct
divisions, that of numbers and that of <i>cadres</i>. Upon the
former it is possible for the player to win thirty-five
times the value of his stake; but then, the bank has
thirty-six chances against him. Upon the <i>cadres</i> there
is not so great a risk; for <i>rouge</i> or <i>noir</i>, <i>pair</i> or <i>impair</i>,
<i>passe</i> or <i>manque</i>, there are nearly the same chances for
the players as there are for the bank; but then, on the
other hand, the player can win no more than the value
of his stake.</p>

<p>The bank, with the odds on zero, normally absorbs
one-seventieth of all the money staked on each table
during the course of the year; that would be against
constant players with capital behind them equal to the
bank; but the majority of players take a comparatively
limited sum with them and play without a system, until
it is lost, and then perforce stop; whereas if they had
the bank’s unlimited time and capital, they would play,
losing only one-seventieth of their stake on each coup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and prolong the time required to lose a given capital.
This constant game of what would in America be called
“freeze out,” enormously increases the bank’s chances
over the calculable one-seventieths of the staker, and is
doubtless the main cause of its large winnings. The
<i>profits</i> of the company were, in 1904, something like
£1,250,000. This, at the calculable odds, would mean
the staking during the year of the enormous sum of
£87,500,000. But owing to the way the usual player
stakes, as above described, probably a small fractional
part of that sum would be sufficient to provide that
amount of revenue. As M. Blanc was wont to say:
“Rouge gagne quelque fois; noir aussi quelque fois&mdash;mais
<i>Blanc</i> toujours.”</p>

<p>If players had unlimited capital, and were allowed
without check to adopt the martingale or pyramid
system, they would run small chance of losing. This
consists in choosing a <i>cadre</i> and playing resolutely upon
it, each time doubling the stake, until that which is
backed wins, which it is certain to do if continued long
enough. When it wins, the player has recovered the
total of his stakes plus one, except the toll on zero,
whereupon he would revert to the minimum stake. But
the bank knows this as well as any one, and draws a line
beyond which there is no doubling allowed.</p>

<p>At roulette, the minimum stake is five francs; but at
trente-et-quarante, a game at cards, the lowest stake is
twenty francs. The amount of systems proposed, published,
and advertised, is prodigious: every one has his
system, who is an enthusiastic gambler, and every one
has led to confusion and loss. One hears at intervals
of lucky players who have broken the bank. But
what guarantee have we that these are not decoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
ducks, or at all events persons allowed to do so, as
an advertisement, and a means of luring other persons
to try their chance to do the same? The last of
those who has written is one Josephine Lorenz, <i>Schaff
dir Gold in Monte Carlo</i>, published at Munich in 1905.
Sir Hiram Maxim in his <i>Monte Carlo</i>, London, 1904,
tells a significant story about the breaking of the
bank by Lord Rosslyn and the late Mr. Sam Lewis.
After about seven consecutive wins, it was said that
the bank had been broken; a bell was rung, and a
factor of the bank was summoned and required to
bring a fresh supply of money. It was delivered, the
play proceeded, and a second time the bank was broken.
This led to immense excitement: hundreds of people
crowded about the table and followed the lead of the
two lucky stakers, with their smaller ventures. The next
time they won on seventeen coups; after that, however,
each lost 12,000 francs, and those who had docilely
followed them lost also. The bank was not really broken
the third time, but pretended and proclaimed that it had
been.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“However,” says Sir Hiram, “my suspicions were excited;
I did not believe for a moment that the bank had actually been
broken. I knew that there had been a great deal of play
during the day, and that the winnings at this particular table
must have been very heavy indeed. I therefore remained to
see the money taken from the table, when I found it was
exactly as I had expected; there was at least a peck of large
bank notes. It had not been necessary for the bank to send
for money at all; this had been done for effect. It was telegraphed
all over the world that Lord Rosslyn and Mr. Sam
Lewis had broken the bank three consecutive times in a single
evening. True, the bank had lost money, but they turned
it into a valuable advertisement.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>That is not all. Next day Lord Rosslyn and Mr. Lewis
again tried their luck, and lost at whatever they tried,
whether at roulette or at trente-et-quarante. Lord
Rosslyn staked fifteen times in as many minutes, and
never won a single “coup.”</p>

<p>Sir Hiram drily observes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Considered from a purely mathematical standpoint, it
would appear very remarkable that he should win seventeen
consecutive times in the evening, and lose fifteen consecutive
times the following morning.”</p>

<p class="p1">Captain Weihe of Hamburg, of the German Marine
Artillery, has published in German and Italian a
<i>brochure</i>, entitled, in the former language, <i>Das Falschspiel
in Monte Carlo</i>, in which he brings a charge of
fraud against the company, based on his observation
during three seasons of steady watching the play. Now
the chances of the ball entering a given pocket are
calculable. According to him, the number of times, say
in a thousand, in which, by the law of chances, the ball
ought to enter a given number is calculable, here, however,
it does not obey the law of chances.</p>

<p>Further, he says that he noticed that wealthy players
were encouraged to proceed, by winning stake after
stake, and then, all at once, luck would declare against
them. Why, he wonders, should such men be lucky at
first and only unlucky afterwards?</p>

<p>Then, he asserts that the agents of the company
occasionally encourage a timorous player by advice,
given with all secrecy, to stake on a certain number,
and that then, by some remarkable coincidence, this
number will win. These observations, he says, led him
to the conclusion that there existed some method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
whereby the ball could be directed to go where the
croupiers desired that it should go. Then he asserts
that he assured himself that a piece of steel was inserted
in a certain number of the balls, and that these loaded
balls could be drawn into any pocket desired, by the
<i>chef de partie</i>, by means of an electro magnet manipulated
by himself. He further asserts that by close
observation during three seasons, he was able, by
watching the fingers of the <i>chef</i>, to predicate with something
approaching to certainty into which number the
ball would run.</p>

<p>The pamphlet in question is not sold at Nice or
Mentone, and it need not be said is not allowed to pass
over the frontier of the principality of Monaco, but it
can be procured at Bordighera.</p>

<p>However, it appears very improbable that the bank
would run such a risk. It is true that detection of
roguery is not easy, where the tables are in a principality
under an absolute monarch, and where police and
every authority are interested in the continuance of the
gambling. There is, however, the risk of some croupier
“giving away the show”; and there is also the risk of
detection. But&mdash;is cheating necessary? Is it worth its
salt? Let us look closer into the acknowledged system.
While playing on the even chances gives 1·35 per cent.
in favour of the bank, playing on any other gives the
bank 2·70; and as many fools play on those chances
that favour the bank most highly, it is probably safe to
assume that the odds in favour of the bank will average
1·66 on all the tables, both trente-et-quarante and
roulette. If individuals playing would take in <i>all</i> the
money they could afford to lose, divide this into so
many maximums (if one did not suffice) and stake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
full maximum on each chance, and then retire, whether
winners or losers, they would then have given the bank
the least possible advantage, as they would have subjected
themselves to the chances of the zero appearing
the least possible number of times. As, however, almost
every player wishes to have as long a run for his
money as possible, almost all players, whether playing
by a so-called system or not, divide their stakes, whether
made on an increasing or on a decreasing scale, or haphazard,
into a number of comparatively small stakes, so
as to stay in the game as long as possible, with the
result that the bank’s percentage is constantly working
against them. The thinner they spread out their money,
and the longer they stay in the game, the greater are the
chances of their losing their money.</p>

<p>If you go into the stock-market and buy the first
stock your eye happens to catch on the list, you at least
stand an even chance of its going up or down, while
your brokerage and stamp charges will not amount to
the 1·66 per cent. charged as brokerage by the Casino;
whereas in the stock market the action will be comparatively
slow, at Monte Carlo the brokerage charge is
approximately 1·66 per minute. If fifty <i>coups</i> are
played per hour, it means that as brokerage the bank
each hour absorbs 83 per cent. of all the money staked
for one <i>coup</i>, while each day the bank takes for its commission
for permitting you to play there, about ten
times the average amount staked on the table at any
one time. As Sir Hiram Maxim says, the martingale
is the least defective of all the systems. Were there no
limit and no zero, this system of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.
must infallibly win, as, whenever a gain is made, no
matter how many previous losses there have been, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
lands the player a winner of one unit. The defect,
however, is that, starting with the minimum stake, the
maximum is reached at the eleventh doubling, and
a run of eleven is of by no means an infrequent occurrence.
Against this the bank protects itself in its most
vulnerable place; even then, were its limits removed,
yet it would be steadily levying its 1·66 commission.</p>

<p>It is accordingly not necessary for the company to
have recourse to underhand work as charged by Captain
Weihe; the income of £1,245,008 realised without
trickery, on an average stake per table would be 611·55 fr.
Any one who has been at Monte Carlo will admit that
this is probably very much below the average amount of
money on the table at each spin of the wheel; and with
such an income, where arises the occasion for illicitly
supplementing it? The following is a table of stakes
needed to realise the known <i>profits</i> of the company:</p>

<p class="p1">Thus enabling the bank on average stakes of 611·55
francs to realise £1,245,008. But it must be remembered
that it is only during the winter season that considerable
play takes place at Monte Carlo. Also that before
profits are declared the prince has to pocket his share,
all the officials have to be paid, the police, the lighting,
the gardens have to be kept going, and the scores of
unacknowledged dependents on the Casino have to
receive enough to maintain them. Every season a little
book appears, advocating an infallible system, and some
of these cost twenty-five francs. Of course, every system
is based on the assumption that there is no trickery.
But if there be trickery, not one of these systems is
worth the cost of the book that advocates it.</p>

<p>“Le rouge gagne quelque fois, le noir gagne quelque
fois, le <i>blanc</i> toujours.”</p>

<p>A very good story is told by “V. B.” in <i>Monte Carlo
Anecdotes</i>, London, 1901. A few years ago a nobleman
attended the English chapel and slipped out as the
hymn was being sung before the sermon, as he went for
worship and not be bored with the discourse. Now
the hymn was No. 32, Ancient and Modern. He
sauntered up to the Casino whistling the tune, and as
he entered the rooms he heard, “Trente-deux, rouge,
pair et passe!” sung out from the table on his right;
and then from that on his left, “Trente-deux, rouge,
pair et passe.” “Bless my soul!” said he, “that is the
number of the hymn; be hanged if I won’t stake on it.”
He hurriedly felt in his pocket, and going to the third
table he announced, “Trente-deux en plein, les quatres
chevaux, et quatres carrés par cinq francs”; and up
rolled the number. To make a long story short, by
passing from table to table, and by constantly clinging
to 32 with gradually increasing stakes, he left the
rooms with over £500 in his pocket. But this got wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and, to the perplexity of the chaplain, next Sunday half
his congregation left the chapel during the hymn before
the sermon and rushed off to the Casino to back the
number of the hymn.</p>

<p>After this it became the rule at the Monte Carlo
English chapel never thenceforth to give out a number
under thirty-seven before the sermon.</p>

<p>On the promontory of La Veille at the water’s edge
is a grotto. When Edward Augustus, Duke of York,
brother to George III., was on his way to Italy on a
man-of-war, feeling too ill to proceed he was landed
at Monaco and received into the palace, where he
died in 1767. The body was embalmed and taken to
London.</p>

<p>Fishermen always make the sign of the cross when
passing the entrance of the Grotte de la Veille, for they
say that when the vessel on which was the Duke of
York arrived in the bay, a white form was seen, as that
of a woman, at the entrance, watching the evolutions
of the ship. After the Duke was removed she still
remained visible, with her face turned towards the
palace. She was again seen when the cannon announced
his death, and again when his body was removed.
The sailors hurry by the cave, and will on no account
enter it. It might be as well if travellers crossed themselves
and hurried by, instead of allowing themselves to
be drawn into the halls of the Circe of Gambling on the
top of the cliff.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE traveller by rail from Nice to Mentone is hardly
able to appreciate the configuration of the land,
and to understand what are the special advantages
enjoyed by Mentone over Nice and Cannes.</p>

<p>Let us take a sickle to represent the mountain system
from the Swiss Alps to the Abruzzi. If the sickle be
held with the point upward and the cutting edge turned
away from one, then the great curve of the inner edge
represents the vast basin of the Po and its tributaries.
At Mont Blanc the Alpine sweep turns south and runs
to Monte Viso, forming the Dauphiné Alps. From
Monte Viso the ridge curves to the east till it meets the
shank above Genoa, and the handle of the sickle is the
range of the Apennines.</p>

<p>From Nice one can see the snowy peaks. Les Cimes
du Diable are visible, but away to the north-east, for the
chain is on the curve there. Above the Riviera di
Ponente the chain draws very near to the sea, but
throws out spurs and allows of a ledge resting against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
it, intervening between it and the Mediterranean. Now
in leaving Nice by the Corniche Road we can see this
formation, we learn how the Alps describe a great
arc; but this is lost to us in the train, hugging the sea-shore
and diving in and out of tunnels.</p>

<p>It is only by the Corniche Road, when we have
reached La Turbie, that we discern how specially
privileged are Mentone and the Italian Riviera. We
see before us an amphitheatre, with mountain stages,
and the blue sea for arena. The mountains run up to
3,000 and 4,000 feet, and wall about the fertile bottom,
the seats about the sea, sheltering them from every
blast. The higher mountains of grey limestone are
bare, but below all is rich with luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The entire bay and the town of Mentone, with its background
of swelling, olive-clad hills closed in by the amphitheatre
of mountains, are thus thoroughly protected from the north-west,
north, and north-east winds. To thoroughly understand and
appreciate the district and its singularly protected character, a
boat should be taken, and the panorama viewed a mile or two
from the shore. The extreme beauty of the coast will amply
repay the trouble. Thus seen, all the details are blended into
one harmonious whole; the two bays becoming one, and the
little town scarcely dividing them. The grandeur of the semicircular
range of mountains, generally steeped in glorious sunshine,
also comes out in broad outline. These mountains
positively appear to all but encircle the Mentonian amphitheatre
in their arms, to thus separate it and its inhabitants from the
world at large, and to present it to the blue Mediterranean
waves and to the warm southern sunshine.</p>

<p>“Behind the mountains which thus form the background of
the Mentonian valleys, are still higher mountains, rising in
successive ranges to an altitude of from 5,000 to 9,000 feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The higher ranges constitute the high Alps of Savoy and
Dauphiné. The presence of this second and higher mountain
range greatly increases the protection afforded to the coast-line
by the lower one, and partly explains its immunity from the
winter cold of continental Europe.</p>

<p>“Thus the Mentone amphitheatre, being only open to the
south, south-east, and south-west, the Mistral, as a north-west
wind, is not at all felt, and but slightly as a deflected south-west
wind. All the northerly winds pass over the higher
mountains and fall into the sea at some distance&mdash;several miles
from the shore. When they reign there is a calm, not only in
the bay at Mentone, but for some distance out at sea; whilst
at a few miles from the shore it may be crested and furious.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">But this protected and warm nook can be enjoyed
only during the months in the depth of winter. When
the sun begins to gather warmth, the heat becomes
oppressive, the lungs gasp for air, and one feels desirous
to be invested with sufficient faith to be able to move
the mountains some miles back. There are two
Mentones, the very dashing, frivolous, up-to-date
modern town, with expensive tastes; bound for life to
the elderly Mentone, grave, a little dilapidated, and
intent only on business. But young and gay Mentone
is stealing an arm round the old partner and laying
hold of the even more sheltered and balmy bay beyond,
now dotted with villas, and punctuated with hotels.</p>

<p>Mentone is pre-eminently the district of lemons and
oranges, grown here for the fruit, and not, as at Grasse,
for the flower. Lemons at Mentone are more numerous
than oranges. They are not so beautiful, as the fruit
has not the golden hue of the orange&mdash;it is green or pale
sulphur yellow. The fruit of the orange tree will bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
7° Fahr. below freezing point without being seriously
affected, but the lemon tree is much more sensitive, and
is killed by 8°; it may also perish by over-much moisture
in the atmosphere. When a sharp frost sets in, the
owners of a plantation of oranges or lemons are in dire
alarm, and light fires in the groves, strewing green leaves
and grass over the flames to produce smoke, which
to a considerable extent prevents radiation, and the
temperature falling too low.</p>

<p>The lemon tree flowers throughout the year, never
resting, flower and fruit being on the tree at the same
time. On no other part of the coast do these trees grow
as freely as they do at Mentone and Bordighera. But
there are no ancient lemon trees, as about once in thirty-five
years a bitter winter sets in, and the poor trees
perish.</p>

<p>The orange tree flowers once only in the year, and
bears but a single crop. The fruit ripens in autumn and
winter. We, in England, never have the orange in its
perfection, as it is picked when green or turning golden
and ripens in the cases in which it is packed. But for
the orange to be in perfection, luscious and sweet, it
should be left on the tree till the end of April, or even
into May. It is a beautiful sight, during the winter, to
see the orange groves laden with their glorious fruit.
The most delicious oranges are those with thin skins,
the Mandarin or Tangerine, which ripen earlier than do
the Portuguese thick-skinned species.</p>

<p>The history of Mentone is not of great interest, and
it may be dismissed in a few words. Mentone and rock-perched
Roquebrune belonged to the Prince of Monaco.
The Grimaldi, John II., having quarrelled with Genoa,
appealed for help to the Duke of Savoy, and to buy this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
help, in 1448 ceded these two places to him for an annual
rent of 200 gold florins. However, the Grimaldi got
this territory back again, but lost it in 1848, when
Mentone and Roquebrune revolted against the fiscal
burdens imposed on them by the Prince, and declared
themselves independent republics. The President of
the Republic of Mentone was Charles Trenca, who died
in 1853. Finally, in 1860, both places were united to
France, and the claims of the Prince of Monaco were
bought off for the sum of four million francs.</p>

<p>There is little of architectural interest in Mentone.
The church, built in 1619, and added to in 1675, is in the
tasteless style of the period, but tower and spire are
effective from a distance. In the church is preserved a
processional cross, the staff of which is formed out of a
Turkish lance taken by Prince Honoré I. of Monaco, in
the battle of Lepanto, 1571. But if Mentone be somewhat
deficient in picturesque features, the same cannot
be said of Roquebrune, which for so many centuries
shared its fortunes. It is dominated by the castle of
the Lascaris. At Roquebrune, every year, on the first
Sunday in August, the Mystery of the Passion is
represented in a procession that illustrates the various
scenes of the portentous tragedy. It starts from the
chapel of N.D. de la Pansa, on the east side of the little
town, a chapel decorated with frescoes of the fifteenth
century. The narrow streets, passing under vaults, the
quaintness of the houses, above all the superb panorama
commanded by Roquebrune, make it a place meriting
a visit.</p>

<p>Still more quaint and picturesque is Castellar, forming
a quadrilateral fortress, planted on a plateau commanding
two valleys. It is composed of three long parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
streets. The exterior of the village or town is the wall
that encloses the place, and the houses thus form the
wall, and look outward only through eyelet holes.
Turrets flank the angles. The chapel of S. Sebastian
is romanesque. Here also the Lascaris had a palace.
Castellar stands 1,200 feet above the sea. We can
hardly realise till how late a period the pirates of the
Mediterranean were a scourge to this coast, and forced
the natives to build every village and town in a place
not easily accessible, and form of it a fortress.</p>

<p>For many centuries first the Saracens, then the Turks
and Moors of Tunis and Algiers, ravaged this coast. Not
so much for gold and silver&mdash;for of this the poor fishermen,
shepherds, and tillers of the soil had none, but to
capture slaves. The women were handsome and the
men able-bodied.</p>

<p>“There are still men living at Mentone,” says Dr.
Bennet, “who in the early part of this century (<i>i.e.</i> 19th)
were seized on the coast by Moors, and subsequently
lived for years as slaves at Algiers and Tunis.” Indeed,
piracy reigned supreme on the Mediterranean until the
year 1816, when Lord Exmouth bombarded Algiers;
but it was not finally stamped out till the conquest of
Algiers by the French in 1830. When Lord Exmouth
bombarded Algiers, there were thousands of Christian
slaves, mostly captured on the Riviera, serving in the
Algerine galleys. It was against the sudden descent of
these pirates that the watch towers were erected along the
coast, which may be seen at intervals as far as Genoa.</p>

<p>At Castellar, on the Place de la Mairie, is given on
January 20th, every year, an open-air ball which winds
up the series of festivities, religious and secular, accorded
in honour of the patronal saint, S. Sebastian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Mentone was “invented” by Dr. J. Henry Bennet,
whose delightful book on <i>Winter and Spring on the
Shores of the Mediterranean</i>, 1861, has gone through
several editions, and is still the best guide to such as
are in quest of a winter resort. He settled at Mentone
in 1859, and speedily appreciated its climatic advantages.
These advantages are inestimable for the worst
winter months. But when the sun gathers strength, it
is advisable for the traveller to break his return journey
to the cold and fogs of England by a cool bath in
S. Raphael “ventosa.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Hanbury has also done much for the
place. His gardens are well worth seeing. An electric
tram will take a visitor along the bay to a fountain
erected by Sir Thomas Hanbury, near the frontier of
Italy. That frontier runs down the torrent of S. Louis,
where may be seen, on a fine day, sketchers and painters
engaged in transferring to their books or canvases the
impression produced by this ravine, with arches one above
the other, for the railway and for the Corniche Road,
whilst below are women washing garments in the little
stream. The magnificent cliffs rise here in sheer precipices,
and are composed of nummulitic limestone.
Formerly the headland stretched to the sea, leaving only
a strip between the rocks and the waves, along which
strip ran the Via Aurelia. The rock was perforated
with caves, nine in number. But it has been cut back
for building stone, and the grottoes have been much
reduced in depth. The caves served as a habitation for
man from a remote period, and not solely as a habitation,
but also as a sepulchre. The Barma Grande was filled
to a depth of thirty feet of deposit, that deposit consisting
of fallen stones, bones of beasts, flint weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and tools, remains of hearths and charcoal, and human
skeletons.</p>

<p>It has been dug into by many and various explorers,
and not always with judgment, and with precise record
of the depths at which various discoveries have been
made.</p>

<p>The present proprietor used the soil for the purpose
of making a garden, and it was only when he came
upon human remains that it occurred to him that he
could turn the cavern into a show place, and get more
out of it in that way than he could by growing cabbages
in the soil removed from it. In these caves a considerable
number of skeletons have been found; in the first,
the Grotte des Enfants, two bodies were discovered of
children of six and four years old, lying at a depth of
eight feet, side by side. They had evidently been
clothed in little loin-cloths embroidered with pierced
shells.</p>

<p>In the fourth cave, the Grotte du Cavillon, was found
the skeleton of an adult twenty feet below the surface,
lying on his left side, the cheek resting on the left hand,
and the head and body had been dusted over with red
ochre, which had stained the bones. The head had
been covered with a sort of cap made of, or adorned
with, perforated shells and dogs’ teeth, and similar
ornaments must have been stitched on to garters about
his legs.</p>

<p>The sixth cave, Bausso da Torre, furnished two
bodies of adults and one of a child, and with these
were flint weapons, bracelets, and necklets of shells.</p>

<p>In 1884 M. Louis Julien found a human skeleton
lying at a depth of twenty-five feet, the head bedded in
red ochre, and near it numerous flakes of flint. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
then others have been found, and the present proprietor
has preserved them <i>in situ</i>, under glass, in the cave, at
the precise levels at which discovered. In 1892, three
were found, all lying on their left sides. One of these had
pertained to a young woman. All three had been
buried along with their personal ornaments, and all with
the ferruginous powder over them.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1894, another human skeleton was unearthed
at a higher level; and soon after again another.</p>

<p>All these interments belong to man at a period before
the use of metals was known, and when the only tools
employed were of bone and flint. The purpose of
covering them with red oxide was to give to the bodies
a fictitious appearance of life. The men were of a
great size, tall and well built, taller indeed than are the
natives of the Riviera at the present day; and the heads
are well developed&mdash;the skulls contained plenty of
brains, and there is nothing simian about the faces.</p>

<p>A little prehistoric museum has been built on a
platform near the caves, where most of the relics found
in them are preserved; but some are in the museum at
Mentone itself.</p>

<span class="mid">BORDIGHERA</span></h2>

<p class="pch">Ventimiglia&mdash;Internecine conflicts&mdash;Republics&mdash;Genoa obtains the
Ligurian coast&mdash;Siege of Ventimiglia&mdash;Guelf and Ghibellines&mdash;The
Lascaris family: Paul Louis Lascaris&mdash;The Cathedral and Baptistery&mdash;S.
Michaele&mdash;Camporosso&mdash;Dolceacqua&mdash;Bordighera&mdash;San Ampelio&mdash;Relics&mdash;Retreat of the sea.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">VENTIMIGLIA, crowning a rocky ridge above the
Roya, was formerly the capital of a county comprising
of all the coast to Porto Maurizio. What
Mr. Adington Symonds says of Italian towns generally
in the Middle Ages applies equally to those on the
Riviera:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It would seem as though the most ancient furies of
antagonistic races, enchained and suspended for centuries
by the magic of Rome, had been unloosed; as though the
indigenous populations, tamed by antique culture, were reverting
to their primeval instincts. Nor is this the end of
the perplexity. Not only are the cities at war with each other,
but they are plunged in ceaseless strife within the circuit of
their ramparts. The people with the nobles, the burghs with
the castles, the plebeians with the burgher aristocracy, the
men of commerce with the men of arms and ancient lineage,
Guelfs and Ghibellines, clash together in persistent fury.
One half the city expels the other half. The exiles roam
abroad, cement alliances, and return to extirpate their conquerors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Fresh proscriptions and new expulsions follow.
Again alliances are made and revolutions are accomplished.
All the ancient feuds of the towns are crossed, recrossed, and
tangled in a web of madness that defies analysis.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Certain prominent and prevailing features pertain to
this portion of the Ligurian seaboard. The towns,
even the villages, are planted in spots as inaccessible
as could be obtained; they were all walled about in the
rocks whereon they stood, and were so crowded within
their walls that the “high street” does not attain to a
width beyond nine feet, and every lateral street is six
feet and even less in width. The houses run to a great
height, and hold themselves up mutually by throwing
out buttresses, arched beneath, for their stay one against
another. The inhabitants of the seaboard were driven
to this by fear of the Moorish pirates.</p>

<p>These little communities organised themselves as
republics, with their consuls, freely elected. But the
nobles, living in their castles, looked upon them with
jealous eyes. They had their serfs under them, and
they saw that these villages and towns were growing in
consequence and in wealth. Unhappily every town was
at enmity with every other town&mdash;each was jealous of the
other; and the nobles offered their services, generally to
a distant town against that nearest at hand. When they
had served against the rival place, they asked for, and
were allowed, a town residence. Then the palace of the
noble in the walled city, or even village, became a centre
of intrigue. Parties were formed in every town, and
the nobles and wealthy burghers arrogated to themselves
supreme control over the affairs of the place. This led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to revolts and fighting in the streets. On the Ligurian
coast, the Republic of Genoa stepped in, took advantage
of these civic broils, and, by plausible assurances of good
government under her strong hand, managed to get
nearly the whole seaboard, with its towns, under her protection.
The protection Genoa afforded soon turned to
exaction and interference with the liberties of the towns
she protected. Thenceforth ensued a series of revolts.</p>

<p>Ventimiglia, which was a place under the rule of its
count, was taken and sacked by the Genoese in 1140,
and its count constrained to make submission. The
mouth of the Roya, with its harbour, excited the jealousy
and ambition of Genoa, as did in like manner Nice and
Villefranche; for Genoa desired to monopolise the whole
of the trade of the Mediterranean along the Ligurian
coast and Corsica. Allies and friendly towns could
traffic freely with Genoa; but the ships of independent
states were taxed, and their freights almost crushed by
onerous duties, before they could enter the port. The
sea-coast towns like Ventimiglia and Villefranche, not
under Genoese control, were a hindrance to the control
and monopoly of the entire trade by the grasping
Republic, consequently the Genoese were persistent in
their attempts to force them to submission.</p>

<p>In 1196 the count and the Genoese combined against
the city of Ventimiglia, and failing, in spite of a siege
of two months, to capture the town, they organised a
league of the whole of Liguria against the gallant and
resolute place. The allies established their camp on the
Cape of S. Ampelio and ravaged the country, but could
not reduce Ventimiglia. Then the Genoese spread a
report that a large Ventimiglian galley which had been
cruising off the Spanish coast had been captured, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that all the crew would be hung unless the town surrendered.
The Ventimiglians, in great alarm for their
kinsmen, submitted, and the Genoese entered and took
possession of the town.</p>

<p>In the year 1238 ensued a general rising in places
of importance along the coast occasioned by the intolerable
exactions of Genoa, and its interference with the
liberties of the towns. The governor of Ventimiglia
took refuge in the castle and sent a messenger to Genoa
for help.</p>

<p>Fourteen Genoese galleys were despatched to his aid,
and hovered about the mouth of the Roya. After a
severe conflict, the Genoese succeeded in landing and
taking the city. At this time a number of the citizens
migrated and founded a colony at Bordighera, but of
this the Genoese disapproved, and they sent a fleet in
1239 and destroyed the little settlement. The contests
of Guelfs and Ghibellines broke out, to aggravate the
disorder and misery of the country.</p>

<p>Some clear-headed men saw that Italy was, like ancient
Greece, a congeries of conflicting atoms with no bond, no
consistence, and no chance of becoming a nation, a power,
that no chance existed of domestic strife being stayed
unless there were some strong central government to
hold all the jarring elements in compulsory quietude.
They looked back to the grand days of Rome, and
hoped, under an emperor, to make of Italy once again
what she had been, a dominant power in the world, and
one in which, within her Italian borders, peace would be
maintained. This was the Ghibelline dream and policy.
But the opposed faction was for the maintenance of the
present disintegration, the continuance of the independence
of every little town, or rather of its own party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in the town. The Pope naturally was zealous on this
side. He dreaded an united and strong Italy, which
would control him. His only chance of occupying the
most prominent place and exerting the greatest power
in the Peninsula lay in fomenting disorder, in setting
every princeling and every town by the ears. Accordingly,
whilst posturing as champion of the liberties
of the republics, he was actuated solely by self-interest,
which lay in keeping all powers in Italy weak by
periodical blood-letting. The Papacy was the great and
persistent enemy to national unity. The party of
independence was that of the Guelfs.</p>

<p>Frederick II. united the empire and the kingdom of
the Two Sicilies under one sceptre. Master of the South,
he sought to recover the lost prerogatives of the empire
in Lombardy and Tuscany, and it is probable that he
would have succeeded and consolidated Italy into one
kingdom but for the bitter hostility of the Papacy, which
carried on an implacable war of extermination against
the house of Hohenstaufen. The struggle was for an
united Italy, a strong Italy, a peaceful Italy, and this
was precisely what the Popes would not endure to have.
They dreaded the formation of a single kingdom in
Italy, with, as a consequence, the presence there of a
rival and predominant power. But this purpose of the
Popes was not seen clearly at the time. Dante saw it;
he knew that the future of Italy was involved in the
contest, and he could not understand aloofness in the
strife. He terms those who did not feel the pangs and
ecstasies of partisanship in this mortal strife, “wretches
who never lived,” and he consigned them to wander
homeless on the skirts of limbo, among the off-scourings
of creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Banners, ensigns, heraldic colours, followed the divisions
of faction. Ghibellines wore the feathers in their caps
on one side, Guelfs on the other. Ghibellines cut up
their fruit at table crosswise, Guelfs straight down;
Ghibellines sported white roses, Guelfs affected those
that were red. Yawning, throwing of dice, gestures in
speaking, and swearing, served as pretexts for distinguishing
the one half of Italy from the other. So late as the
middle of the fifteenth century, the Ghibellines of Milan
pulled down the figure of Christ from the high altar of
Crema, and burnt it, because the face was turned towards
the Guelf shoulder.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Grimaldi were strong Guelfs;
the county of Nice was so as well, but the town was
Ghibelline. The Lascaris of Tende and Ventimiglia, the
Dorias of Dolceacqua and Oneglia were Ghibelline.</p>

<p>The county of Ventimiglia had been formed in 778
by Charlemagne, and given by him to a Genoese noble,
Guido Guerra, with the title of Marquess of the Maritime
Alps, on condition that he should maintain at his own
cost a company of soldiers to defend the littoral within
his Marquisate. The county passed in the thirteenth
century to William, son of the Greek Emperor Lascaris
II., of Nicæa, who married the heiress and descendant of
the Guido Guerra family. But William Lascaris soon
after ceded the county to Charles of Anjou, in exchange
for diverse other fiefs in the interior of Provence, amongst
others that of Tourvès, between Brignoles and S.
Maximin, where may be seen the ruins of the noble
castle of the Lascaris. In 1266, Charles of Anjou, in his
turn, ceded the county of Ventimiglia to the Grimaldi
and Fieschi, consuls of the Republic of Genoa, on
the condition that they should furnish provisions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
munitions to the Provençal troops occupying the kingdom
of Naples.</p>

<p>The county of Tende was founded by Charles of
Anjou for the Princess Irene, daughter of Theodore
Lascaris, and sister of the above-mentioned William,
when she married Robert Guerra of the family of the
Counts of Ventimiglia, and Robert then abandoned his
patronymic of Guerra and assumed that of Lascaris.
The county of Tende subsisted till 1579, and was then
ceded by Henrietta, Duchess of Maine, last descendant
of the Lascaris-Guerra to Emmanuel-Philibert, Duke of
Savoy.</p>

<p>Theodore Lascaris I. had married Anna, daughter of
Alexis III., and he was chosen Emperor of Constantinople
at the time when the Crusaders occupied Byzantium
and founded there a Latin empire, under Baldwin of
Flanders, 1204. Theodore was constrained to fly into
Anatolia and make of Nicæa the capital of the Greek
empire; so it remained till the expulsion of the Latins
in 1261. The only daughter of Theodore Lascaris I.
married John Ducas, who succeeded to the Empire of
Nicæa. Ducas died in 1255, leaving a son, Theodore
Lascaris II., who died in 1259, and his eight-year-old son
John remained to be the victim of the unscrupulous
Michael Palæologus, who had his eyes torn out. This
John had, however, five sisters, and one of these,
Eudoxia, in 1263 married William, Count of Ventimiglia;
and another, Irene, became, as already said, the
mother and ancestress of the Lascaris Counts of Tende.
The Lascaris arms are: gules, a two-headed eagle displayed,
or.</p>

<p>Paul Louis Lascaris, who entered the Order of Malta,
belonged to the Ventimiglian branch of the family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
He was born in Provence in 1774. He was on the isle
when Napoleon appeared before Malta in 1798. Hompesch
was Grand Master, a weak old man; the
knights of the Order might easily have defended the
island till the English fleet under Nelson came to its
aid, but French gold and promises had created a party
of traitors within; of these Lascaris was chief, and on
June 11th La Valetta capitulated. “On my word,”
said General Caffarelli, “it is well that there was someone
inside to unlock the gates to us, for otherwise we
should never have got in.”</p>

<p>After his treason Lascaris did not venture to remain
in Malta, but attended Bonaparte to Egypt. Upon the
rupture of the Treaty of Amiens in 1803, Napoleon,
having resolved on attacking the English in India, commissioned
Lascaris to go to the East, there make the
necessary studies for the execution of his plan, and
explore the frontiers, map down roads, wells, etc.
Whilst Lascaris was in the East he married a beautiful
Georgian akin to Soliman Pacha. In 1810 he visited
in succession the Arab tribes in Mesopotamia, and
turned his face homewards in 1814. On reaching Constantinople
he heard of the fall of Bonaparte, and departed
for Cairo, where he died shortly after, and all
his notes and maps fell into the hands of the British
consul there. All known of his adventures in the East
comes from a narrative given to the world by his
dragoman Fatalba.</p>

<p>Ventimiglia is not only in itself a marvel of picturesqueness,
occupying a ridge above the Roya, but its
situation, with the sea before and the snow-clad Alps
behind, is exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>The streets are narrow, as space was precious, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the Strada Grande is lined with quaint old houses of
the city nobility and well-to-do citizens, and have
marble balconies, their sculptured entrances, and heraldic
decorations. The cathedral occupies a terrace, with the
palace of the Lascaris having an open loggia and staircase
on one side of the piazza. The cathedral, dedicated
to S. Barnabas, fondly deemed to have founded it, is a
fine church of the thirteenth century, vaulted without
groining ribs. Beneath it, at the east end, is the very
early baptistery, unhappily remodelled in the seventeenth
century. This contains a huge stone baptismal basin,
with stage inside on which children could stand, whereas
it is deep in the middle for adults. Two recesses are
at the sides; one of these is for the priest performing
the ceremony. In the vestries are portraits of the
bishops, several in surplice and rochet, looking very
much like English prelates.</p>

<p>But more interesting even than the cathedral is
S. Michaele, at the farther end of the town, a church
of the twelfth century, with a rich west doorway, having
on the capitals a range of quaint carving of human
beings. The church is vaulted in the same manner as
the cathedral. Beneath the choir is a crypt, one pillar
of which is a milestone from the Via Aurelia, of the
time of the Emperor Antoninus. A slab in the floor
bears rich early interlaced work.</p>

<p>The side aisles of this church had fallen into ruin,
but have been judiciously restored, along with the body
of the church.</p>

<p>Outside the walls of the town, towering above it, are
the remains of a castle, which is held to date from
Roman times, but which was enlarged, altered, and
mainly rebuilt in mediæval days.</p>

<p>At Camporosso, up the Nervia, is a little church of the
early part of the twelfth century, now serving as chapel to
the cemetery. It has apse and tower of this period; the
rest has been rebuilt. It is constructed of rolled stones
from the river-bed. The roof consists of slabs of
nummulite limestone.</p>

<p>Above Camporosso on the Nervia is Dolceacqua.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After winding through woods of olives, carpeted in spring
by young corn and bright green flax, Dolceacqua suddenly
bursts upon the view, stretching across a valley, whose sides
are covered with forests of olives and chestnuts, and which is
backed by fine snow mountains. Through the town winds
the deep blue stream of the Nervia, flowing under a tall
bridge of one wide arch, and above frowns the huge palatial
castle, perched upon a perpendicular cliff, with sunlight
streaming through its long lines of glassless windows. The
streets are almost closed in with archways, which give them
the look of gloomy crypts, only opening here and there to let
in a ray of sunlight and a strip of blue sky. They lead up
the steep ascent to the castle where the Doria once reigned
as sovereign princes.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="p1">An electric tram connects Ventimiglia with Bordighera.
This latter place is unceremoniously dismissed
by Hare in these words: “The town contains nothing
worth seeing.” The statement is certainly incorrect. Old
Bordighera contains a good deal that is worth seeing&mdash;the
quaint town gates, the steep and picturesque streets,
and the glorious view from the little piazza before the
church. There also by the seaside is the chapel of
S. Ampelio with its cave, in which the apostle of the
district lived and died.</p>

<p>Little authentic is known of S. Ampelio, for there
is no early life of him extant. Tradition says that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was a blacksmith from the Thebaid, who left Egypt and
settled here. His bones were carried off in the twelfth
century to San Remo, and thence later to Genoa. The
fête of S. Ampelio is on May 14th. The chapel was
enlarged and restored in 1852.</p>

<p>The transfer of the relics of S. Ampelio to San Remo
exhibits a curious feature of mediæval enthusiasm. In
1140 the citizens of San Remo, at war with Ventimiglia,
took a number of the townsmen prisoners. They would
release them on one condition only, that they should reveal
where were secreted the bones of S. Ampelio. The
Ventimiglians, to obtain their liberty, betrayed the
secret; the old hermit had been laid in the grotto he
had inhabited during his life. Thereupon the people of
San Remo carried off his body.</p>

<p>What is the peculiar fancy for possessing a few
pounds of phosphate of lime? Whence comes the
devotion to relics?</p>

<p>S. Chrysostom tells us of pilgrims travelling from the
ends of the earth to Arabia to see Job’s dunghill, and
he says that they drew “much profit and philosophy”
from the sight.</p>

<p>One can understand how that certain churches should
be greedy to possess relics, and steal, or even invent
them, because the possession brought money into their
coffers; but the money would not have come had there
not been, deep-seated in the hearts of the people, a
conviction that there was something supernatural, a
divine power surrounding and emanating from these
relics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>For my own part I think it is a survival of the
worship of ancestors that existed among the prehistoric
races of Europe. We know that to them the sepulchre,
the dolmen, the kistvaen, the cairn, were the most holy
spots in the world, the centres of their common life, the
tie that bound a clan together. When these primeval
people became absorbed in conquering races, and adopted
other religions, they carried along with them the cult of
old bones and ashes. The ancestor was forgotten, and
the spiritual father, the saint, took his place, and the
worship of the dead was transferred from the ancestor
of the tribe to the apostle of the new religion in the
district.</p>

<p>Bordighera was founded in 1470 by thirty-two families,
who migrated to it from Ventimiglia. There was, however,
at the time some portion of walls standing, and
these new settlers completed the enclosure, and squatted
within.</p>

<p>At one time, perhaps even then, the sea came up
to the foot of the rock, where are now orange and lemon
orchards, but the current that sets from west to east
along this coast filled it up. On digging, the old sea-shore
is found, and the name Bordighera signifies a
creek provided with stakes and nets for catching fish.</p>

<p>Bordighera is happy in having had an exhaustive
historian, Mr. F. F. Hamilton (<i>Bordighera and the
Western Riviera</i>, London, 1883), and this work is supplemented
by Mr. W. Scott’s <i>Rock Villages of the Riviera</i>,
London, 1898, by which he means the villages built
upon rocky heights. He describes only such, however,
as are near Bordighera. This book will be a help to
such as desire to make excursions from that winter
resort, and these two works together render it unnecessary
for me to enter more fully into the history of Ventimiglia
and its offspring Bordighera, and into minute
description of them and their neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="mid">SAN REMO</span></h2>

<p class="pch">Two San Remos&mdash;The Pinecone&mdash;Earthquakes&mdash;Matuta&mdash;Sold to the
Genoese&mdash;Church of S. Syro&mdash;Domestic architecture unchanging&mdash;Narrow
streets&mdash;Leprosy&mdash;San Romolo&mdash;Lampedusa&mdash;River names&mdash;Taggia&mdash;Doctor

date-palm.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE are two San Remos, that of to-day, with
its pretentious villas rivalling each other in ugliness,
and the old San Remo. The former is clean with
open spaces, a broad main street, and is dotted about
with palms and agaves in sub-tropical gardens. The
old San Remo is a network, a labyrinth of narrow,
tortuous lanes. This old portion goes by the name of
<i>la Pigna</i>, the Pinecone, because of the manner in which
the ancient houses are grouped, pressed together one on
another, rising towards a culminating conical point.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The old town is built upon a hill that descends gently
to the sea, and whose summit is crowned by a sanctuary.
The streets twist about, are steep, with steps, and paved
with bricks or rolled stones. The old houses elbow one
another away to get a little breath, or sustain themselves
from falling by stretching out a flying buttress, each
against its <i>vis-à-vis</i>, like tipsy men with linked arms
hoping to keep their feet by mutual support. For all
this coast is liable to be shaken by earthquakes. Diano
Marina was the central point of one in February, 1887,
that shook down half the village. Baiardo was completely
ruined, and church and houses have all been rebuilt.
Numerous lives were lost on this occasion. This portion
of the Riviera, though more sheltered than the French
Côte d’Azur, cannot boast the beauty of mountain outline.
It is only when a river comes down from the Alps that
a view of the snowy peaks is obtained up its course.
The rock is all limestone and conglomerate, and the
slopes are terraced and studded with olives. The
general tints have a sameness and dulness that is not
found on the French Riviera. The hills seem to have
been enveloped in sail-cloth and rolled in powdered
sage-leaves. San Remo lies in the lap of a crescent
bay, of which Cap Verde on the West and Cap Nera on
the East are the two horns. It faces the South, and
a double reef of mountains to the North arrests the
winds from that cold quarter of the heavens. The
shelter thus afforded, the focussing of the sun’s rays on
this spot, and the fertility of the soil, unite to make the
vegetation luxuriant and varied.</p>

<p>By the shore we have orange and lemon groves, the
delicious mandarin orange, and the pomegranate, tropic
palms, agaves, and cactus mingled with cedars. Higher
up are olive gardens, chestnuts. “<i>Tenens media omnia
silvæ</i>,” the pine woods stretch to the top of the hills that
engirdle San Remo.</p>

<p>M. Reclus observes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Strange to say, trees do not ascend to the same height on
these slopes of the Apennines as on the Alps, though the mean
temperature is far higher; and at an altitude at which the
beech still attains noble proportions in Switzerland we find it
here stunted in growth. Larches are hardly ever seen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
sea is as sterile as the land. There are neither shallows,
islands, nor seaweed, affording shelter for fish. The cliffs
descend precipitously to the sea, and the narrow strips of
beach, extending from promontory to promontory, consist of
sand only, without the admixture of a single shell.”</p>

<p class="p1">The ancient name of the place was Matuta, but it had
been destroyed again and again by the Saracens till
the year 1038, when the Count of Ventimiglia made
the place over to the Archbishop of Genoa; he disposed
of it to two nobles, Doria and Mari. But the Dorias
were Ghibelline and the Maris belonged to the opposed
faction, leading to terrible broils. Finally, in 1361 the
Genoese Republic became sole possessors. The town
took the name of S. Romulus, as possessing the bones
of that saint, and the old name of Matuta fell into
desuetude. Saint Romulus has been altered and corrupted
into San Remo. Doubtless whilst under the
rule of the Archbishop of Genoa the interesting church
of S. Syro was built. The style is Lombardic Romanesque.
It was frightfully mutilated in or about 1620,
when the apse was altered and lengthened, and a hideous
baroque façade was erected, like the canvas-painted
frontage to a show in a fair. At the same time the
interior features were disguised under plaster and paint.
In 1745 an English fleet bombarded San Remo, and the
spire was knocked to pieces and replaced by a hideous
structure. But recently a complete restoration has been
effected; the façade has been pulled down, revealing the
original features, and the whole, externally and internally,
treated with such scrupulous fidelity to what was the
original style, that the result is that the church of S. Syro
is now one of the finest monuments of Christian art on
the Riviera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitor from the north of Europe is perplexed
how to determine approximately the dates of the domestic
buildings in every one of these Ligurian towns
and villages. The architecture has a modern look, and
yet the houses are decrepit, ruinous, and shabby. The
windows and doors are square-headed, with scarce a
moulding to differentiate them, and the pointed arch
is only seen in the bridges that tie the houses together.
Rarely, only in some palace or town hall, does the
swallow-tail crenelation, or a feeble imitation of Gothic
cornice, speak of the Middle Ages. The fact is that the
streets are so narrow that there is no room for display
of street architecture in these lanes, <i>culs de sac</i>, and
thoroughfares, that allow no wheeled conveyance to pass
up and down. The houses set their noses against each
other and stare into each other’s eyes. There is no
privacy there, not even in smells. If a man eats garlic,
every one sniffs it in the house opposite. If a woman
administers a curtain lecture, all the occupants of the
houses <i>vis-à-vis</i> prick up their ears, listen to every word,
and mark every intonation of voice. Into no single
room has the sun looked for a thousand years, and air
has been but grudgingly admitted, and never allowed to
circulate. The houses run up five, six, even seven
storeys, and are tenanted by many families. Those
nearest the pavement partake of the first whiff of the
garbage of the street, the dejections of the tenants in
the tenements above; and those in the topmost storey
inhale the flavour of stale humanity ascending from all
the flats below.</p>

<p>But to revert to the architecture. I do not suppose
that it has altered since classic times. We know how
it was in Rome among the <i>insulæ</i>, blocks of dwellings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
crowding the densely occupied lower parts of the town,
running up to great heights, and swarming with people
living on the several stages. The palaces of the nobility,
where facing the street, looked like the fronts of modern
factories. Happily, in Rome one such remains, in the
wall of the church of SS. John and Paul, on the Monte
Clivo. It is a lofty red-brick front, without an ornament,
pierced formerly with square-headed windows or
windows very slightly arched with bricks, precisely such
a face as may be seen to a factory in a side lane of
Manchester, Birmingham, or Leeds.</p>

<p>The Roman noble kept all his decoration for the
inside of his house; his colonnade was towards his
enclosed garden, his marbles about his atrium; externally
his mansion was a barrack. Pointed architecture never
was assimilated by the Italian. He endured it; he used
it for churches, always with a difference. But for his
home he would have none of it. He was surrounded by
remains of the period of Roman domination over the
world, vast structures, solid and enduring. Temples
fell and were despoiled to decorate churches, but private
dwellings, though they might be gutted, could not be
defaced, when they had no face to be mutilated. Vandal,
Lombard, Saracen, swept over the land, burnt and
pillaged, but left the solid walls standing to be re-roofed
and re-occupied after they were gone. Nothing but the
recurrent earthquake affected these structures. And
when a house was shaken down it was rebuilt on the
same lines. If a bit of ornament were desired it was
copied, and badly copied, from some relic of classic times.
Consequently there has been incessant reproduction of
one type. Thus all these old Ligurian towns and villages
appear as if built at one and the same time, in one and
the same style, and all to have fallen simultaneously into
the same disorder, dirt, and raggedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Near to S. Syro is a hospital for leprosy, a disease
which long lingered on in San Remo. Happily it has
disappeared&mdash;at all events from this town&mdash;and in 1883
the building became the Civic Hospital. But leprosy is
by no means extinct on the Ligurian coast;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“it is hopelessly incurable, the limbs and the faces of the
lepers being gradually eaten away, so that with several, while
you look upon one side of the face, and see it apparently in
the bloom of health and youth, the other has already fallen
away and ceased to exist. The disease is hereditary, having
remained in certain families of this district almost from time
immemorial. The members of these families are prohibited
from intermarrying with those of others, or indeed from
marrying at all, unless it is believed that they are free from
any seeds of the fatal inheritance. Sometimes the marriages,
when sanctioned by magistrates and clergy, are contracted in
safety, but often, after a year or two of wedded life, the
terrible enemy appears again, and existence becomes a curse;
thus the fearful legacy is handed on.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hare.</span></p>

<p class="p1">The marvel is that plague, leprosy, and typhoid fever
are not endemic in these Ligurian towns. But the
winter visitor to San Remo may be at ease, he will see
no lepers in the place now. Should a case occur, it
would at once be removed out of sight.</p>

<p>As already said, San Remo takes its name from
S. Romulus, a bishop, whose festival is on October 13th.
Almost nothing is certainly known of this Bishop of
Genoa, who is thought to have died in the year 350.
The story goes that in old age he retired from his
charge to a cave or Barma in the mountains, about
five miles from San Remo. Here formerly was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Benedictine convent, now the very modern building is
occupied by sisters, and the cave of S. Romolo has been
converted into a church with an ugly façade. On the
fête day plenty of Sanremois visit the shrine, some out
of devotion, some for the sake of a picnic, and many
from mixed motives.</p>

<p>But the most delightful excursion that may be made
from San Remo is to Lampedusa, above the Taggia.
For that no better guide can be had than Ruffini’s
delightful novel, <i>Dr. Antonio</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A broad, smooth road, opening from Castellaro northwards,
and stretching over the side of the steep mountains in
capricious zig-zags, now conceals, now gives to view, the front
of the sanctuary, shaded by two oaks of enormous dimensions.
The Castellini, who made this road in the sweat of their brows,
point it out with pride, and well they may. They tell you with
infinite complacency how every one of the pebbles with which
it is paved was brought from the sea-shore, those who had mules
using them for that purpose, those who had none bringing up
loads on their own backs; how every one, gentleman and
peasant, young and old, women and boys, worked day and
night with no other inducement than the love of the Madonna.
The Madonna of Lampedusa is their creed, their occupation,
their pride, their <i>carroccio</i>, their fixed idea.</p>

<p>“All that relates to the miraculous image, and the date and
mode of its translation to Castellaro, is given at full length in
two inscriptions, one in Latin, the other in bad Italian verses,
which are to be seen in the interior of the little chapel of the
sanctuary. Andrea Anfosso, a native of Castellaro, being
the captain of a privateer, was one day attacked and defeated
by the Turks, and carried to the Isle of Lampedusa. Here he
succeeded in making his escape, and hiding himself until the
Turkish vessel which had captured him left the island. Anfosso,
being a man of expedients, set about building a boat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
finding himself in a great dilemma what to do for a sail,
ventured on the bold and original step of taking from the
altar of some church or chapel of the island a picture of the
Madonna to serve as one; and so well did it answer his
purpose, that he made a most prosperous voyage back to his
native shores, and, in a fit of generosity, offered his holy sail
to the worship of his fellow townsmen. The wonder of the
affair does not stop here. A place was chosen by universal
acclamation, two gun-shots in advance of the present sanctuary,
and a chapel erected, in which the gift was deposited with all
due honour. But the Madonna, as it would seem, had an insurmountable
objection to the spot selected, for, every morning
that God made, the picture was found in the exact spot where
the actual church now stands. At length the Castellini came
to understand that it was the Madonna’s express wish that her
headquarters should be shifted to where her resemblance
betook itself every night; and though it had pleased her to
make choice of the most abrupt and the steepest spot on the
whole mountain, just where it was requisite to raise arches in
order to lay a sure foundation for her sanctuary, the Castellini
set themselves <i>con amore</i> to the task so clearly revealed to
them, and this widely-renowned chapel was completed. This
took place in 1619. In the course of time some wings were
annexed for the accommodation of visitors and pilgrims, and
a terrace built; for though the Castellini have but a small
purse, theirs is the great lever which can remove all impediments&mdash;the
faith that brought about the Crusades.</p>

<p>“To the north a long, long vista of deep, dark, frowning
gorges, closed in the distance by a gigantic screen of snow-clad
Alps&mdash;the glorious expanse of the Mediterranean to the
south-east and west, range upon range of gently undulating
hills, softly inclining towards the sea&mdash;in the plain below the
fresh, cozy valley of Taggia, with its sparkling track of waters,
and rich belt of gardens, looking like a perfect mosaic of every
gradation of green, chequered with winding silver arabesques.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Ever and anon a tardy pomegranate in full blossom spreads out
its oriflamme of tulip-shaped dazzling red flowers. From the
rising ground opposite frowns mediæval Taggia, like a discontented
guest at a splendid banquet. A little farther off
westward, the eye takes in the campanile of the Dominican
church, emerging from a group of cypresses, and farther still,
on the extreme verge of the western cliff, the sanctuary of Our
Lady of the Guardia shows its white silhouette against the
dark blue sky.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The name of the river Taggia is synonymous with Tay,
Taw, Tavy; as the Roya is akin to the Irish Rye, the
Spanish Riga. The Neva that mingles its waters with
the Arrosetta, has a cognate Neva in Russia, a Nahe in
Germany, a Never in Wales, and a diminutive Nivelle
in France. The brawling Loup does not take its name
from a wolf. It is misspelled through a false etymology.
It should be Lou, like the river that enters the Dordogne,
and the Devon Lew, the Lee, and Lech by Ulm.
Whence come the many similar river names of Europe?
They are doubtless the most ancient designations we
have, those that have least changed; they were given by
the earliest inhabitants of Europe, and have adhered to
these ever-flowing streams, modified here and there, but
always showing how ancient and primeval they are.
Adam named the beasts, but who&mdash;what race&mdash;named
the rivers? It must have been a race that occupied almost
the whole of Europe. Was it those mighty men of old,
who lie smothered in red ochre in Barma Grande by
Mentone, or was it the mysterious people who reared the
rude stone monuments, and who have left scanty traces
of their lost language embedded in Welsh and Irish?</p>

<p>Taggia itself surely deserves a visit from every one
who has read and loved <i>Dr. Antonio</i>; for there lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the gifted author Giovanni Ruffini from 1875 to 1881,
the year in which he died. The remains of his house
are shown. The church also deserves a visit, on account
of the paintings on wood by Brea and other artists of
the fifteenth century. One painting on a gold ground
by Brea, or a disciple, in the chapel of the tombs of the
Curlo family, is specially noticeable for its beauty. On
the Piazza Umberto I. stands a monument erected in
1896 to the memory of the three Ruffini brothers, who
strove for the unification of Italy.</p>

<p>The story of the Bresca family of San Remo acquiring
the privilege of furnishing palms to Rome, granted
by Sixtus V. in 1586, is well known, but must not be
left unnoticed here.</p>

<p>An obelisk was being elevated in the piazza before
S. Peter’s. This obelisk had been brought to Rome from
Heliopolis by Caligula, in a ship which Pliny describes
as being “nearly as long as the left side of the port of
Ostia.” Sixtus V. was resolved on Christianising or
demolishing the relics of pagan Rome. The obelisk,
if set up before S. Peter’s, might serve to support a
cross. It was removed from its place in the Circus of
Nero by 800 men and 150 horses, under the supervision
of Domenico Fontana, who was threatened with death
if he failed. When it was about to be reared, Sixtus
threatened death to man, woman, or child who should
speak whilst the huge mass was being elevated by means
of forty-six cranes. The great stone was slowly rising
to its base, when suddenly it ceased to move, and it was
evident that the ropes were yielding. An awful moment
of suspense ensued, when the dead silence was broken
by a shout: “<i>Acqua alle funi!</i>” (Throw water on the
ropes!) The workmen at once cast bucketfuls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
liquid over the cordage, that at once began to shrink,
and raised the monstrous mass, and settled it upon its
base.</p>

<p>The man who saved the obelisk was Bresca, a sea
captain of a fishing smack at San Remo. Sixtus V.
inquired after him, and promised him, what cost himself
nothing, as a reward, that ever thenceforth his family
and his native village should have the privilege of
furnishing the palms for S. Peter’s on Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>In order to bleach the leaves for this purpose they are
tied up in a way very similar to that employed by
market gardeners to obtain white centres to lettuces. It
cannot be said that the leaves are made more beautiful
by the process; on the contrary, they lose what little
beauty they had. The branches are bound up so as to
form a vertical roll, in the centre of which are the young
leaves, that have to struggle up, shut off from light
and air, with the result that sickly, ugly strips are
produced, which are sent throughout the Catholic world
for use on the Sunday before Easter. Ten thousand
times preferable are our pretty “palms,” the catkin-bearing
willow twigs.</p>

<p>The date palm is not indigenous. It was probably
introduced by the Crusaders. In an illustration to a MS.
of the Geography of Strabo, presented by Guarini to
King Réné, the king is shown seated with a full-grown
palm tree in the background. Indeed, in the tympanum
of the north doorway of S. Syro, at San Remo, is a
representation of a male and a female palm tree with an
Agnus Dei between them.</p>

<p>The date palm is multiplied by seed and by suckers.
This last mode of propagation is the most advantageous,
as all the plants so produced are females and fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
bearers; and they will bear at the age of five or six
years, whereas those raised from seed produce dates
only after they have attained an age of fifteen or twenty
years.</p>

<p>But it is in a few nooks only of the Riviera that the
date palm ripens its fruit, and that but occasionally, for
the winter comes on before it has reached maturity, and
it fails to acquire the flavour and sweetness which is
attained in Africa. It cannot be said that the huge
bunches of dates in their husks hanging on the trees, of
a sickly yellow, are beautiful.</p>

<span class="mid">ALASSIO</span></h2>

<p class="pch">Admirable site&mdash;Old Alassio&mdash;Church of San Ambrogio&mdash;Palace of the
Ferreri&mdash;Arco Romano&mdash;Gallinaria&mdash;Saint Martin&mdash;Andora&mdash;Oneglia&mdash;Andrew

<p class="drop-cap16">ALASSIO falls short of other winter resorts in no
degree, in sweetness of situation, shelter from
blustering cold winds, and in abundance of objects of
interest in the neighbourhood. In climate, in everything
but one, it equals San Remo, Bordighera, and
Mentone. The one thing it lacks is good shops.</p>

<p>Alassio consists of one narrow street a mile and a
half in length, out of which radiate towards the sea
passages under arches. It does not contain, in itself,
much of interest. The church and the palace of the
Ferreri exhaust the place. The church of San Ambrogio
has a tower of the thirteenth century, and the old church,
altered, remains, with a later church built on to it in the
south in late renaissance times, that is distinctly
pleasing, with its white and black marble and blue-grey
stucco, between the marble pilasters.</p>

<p>The palace of the Ferreri family, with its rich and
cumbrous gateways sculptured with the family arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
contains fine tapestries, family portraits, and rich
furniture.</p>

<p>The arms of the town are curious: argent, a tower out
of which rises a king crowned and wearing garments red
and green.</p>

<p>A favourite excursion from Alassio is to the Arco
Romano, a Roman arch, through which a lovely peep of
the sea is obtained. To the east appears the curious
isle of Gallinaria, shaped like a snail, with the ruins of a
Benedictine monastery on it. In 358, in the midst of
the war against the Allemanni, when the Emperor
Julian was at Worms, Martin, who was in the army, and
a tribune, asked to be released from military duty.
Julian was indignant. A battle was imminent, and he
scornfully refused the petition, and charged Martin with
cowardice. The young tribune replied, “Put me in
the forefront of the army, without weapons or armour,
and prove if I be what you say.”</p>

<p>However, the Allemanni asked for peace, it was
granted, thereupon Martin obtained his dismissal. He
then went to Poitiers and placed himself under the
teaching of S. Hilary. Then he departed to visit his
parents in Pannonia. As he crossed the Alps he was
attacked by robbers and plundered of all he had. On
reaching his native city of Sabaria, Martin succeeded in
converting his mother to Christ, but his father persisted
in his paganism. Then he returned to Italy, and after
tarrying awhile at Milan, where he was vexed by the
Arians, he took refuge on this islet of Gallinaria. There
he lived on roots, and nearly poisoned himself by
accidentally eating the hellebore, attracted by its dark
green leaves and pale flowers. Providentially the
spasms caused by the poison came on so rapidly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to check him from eating enough to kill him; but he
suffered great pain, and lay at death’s door. A cave is
shown in the island which S. Martin is traditionally held
to have inhabited. After some sojourn on Gallinaria,
Martin left it and went back to Poitiers.</p>

<p>To visit the curious old mountain village of Andora,
one must leave the train at Laigueglia, before it rushes
into the tunnel pierced through the spur of rock on
which Andora stands. The church dedicated to SS.
Philip and James is in Lombardic Gothic of the fourteenth
century, and is one of the most interesting monuments
of the style in Liguria. Above the high altar is
a crucifix of carved wood, the figure of natural size,
believed to be still earlier than the church, which dates
from 1341.</p>

<p>Adjoining the church is a tower with swallow-tail
battlements, that belonged to the old castle, but has
now been united to the church. There are also at
Andora the ruins of a feudal castle, the Parasio, the
residence of the Podesta till 1797. There are also
remains of a Roman aqueduct and a Roman bridge over
the river, still in good condition.</p>

<p>Oneglia was the birthplace of Andrew Doria, the
great admiral. It is an ugly town; the prison is in the
shape of a cross, with a huge lantern at the junction of
the arms lighted through cockney Gothic windows.</p>

<p>The Dorias, Fieschi, Grimaldi, and Spinolas were the
four principal families of Genoa. Simone Doria, who
lived in 1270, was a Troubadour, and he once had a dispute
with Lanfranc Cigala as to which was preferable,
to deserve the favour of a lady or to possess it. Doria
maintained the latter proposition. “I did once suppose,”
said Lanfranc, “that merit carried a lady’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
favour, I now know that impudence gains it. Doria
has taught me that.”</p>

<p>Andrew Doria was born at Oneglia in 1468. He
was son of Andrew Coeva, of the Dorias, that were
Princes of Oneglia, but as this Andrew represented a
junior branch, he came into but a small slice of the
inheritance, and, dying early, his widow, mother of the
great Andrew, thought it well to get as the protector of
her boy Dominico Doria, belonging to the elder branch,
and this she obtained by ceding to him the rights in
Oneglia that had belonged to her husband. Dominico
was then captain of the guards to Pope Innocent VIII.,
and he put the young Andrew in his company. Andrew
forged ahead, and became a naval captain of great
importance. He had no scruples, and he passed from
side to side, as best conduced to his interests. At one
time he fought for Francis I., and then he went over to
the service of Charles V. When these rivals met at
Aigues Mortes, Francis I. mounted the galley of the
great admiral, and noticed a bronze cannon with on it
the Arms of France. He looked hard at Doria, who
said, “This gun is of excellent metal.” “I cast better
cannons now,” remarked the King, meaning that he
offered better pay than formerly.</p>

<p>“The Emperor’s metal is good enough for me,”
retorted Doria. Francis turned to the Emperor and
said, “You made a good catch when you netted Doria.
Mind you keep him.”</p>

<p>Against the judgment of Doria Charles V. undertook
his disastrous expedition against Algiers in 1541.
In 1539 Doria, with the Imperial fleet, that of Venice,
and that of the Pope, lighted on the very inferior
Turkish fleet under Kheyr-ed-din Barbarossa, off Previsa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
The Christian strength was really overwhelming.
Eighty Venetians, thirty-six Papal and thirty Spanish
galleys, together with fifty sailing galleons, made up the
formidable total of nearly two hundred ships of war, and
they carried scarcely less than 60,000 men and 2,500
guns. Doria was in chief command, Capello and
Grimano led the Venetian and Roman contingents.
On September 25th the allied fleets appeared off the
Gulf. Barbarossa had 122 ships of war.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th the corsairs were amazed
to see Doria sail away. Germano and Capello went on
board the flagship and urged Doria to engage the enemy;
they even implored him to depart himself, and allow
them to fight the battle with their own ships, but in vain.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The result was practically a victory, and a signal victory,
for the Turks. Two hundred splendid vessels of three great
Christian States had fled before an inferior force of Ottomans;
and it is no wonder that Sultan Suleyman, when he learnt the
news at Yamboli, illuminated the town, and added 100,000
piasters a year to the revenues of Barbarossa.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="pbq">“It was,” says Brantôme, “a common opinion at the time
that there existed a secret engagement between Barbarossa
and Doria to avoid fighting each other on decisive occasions,
so as to prolong the war, which gave both of them employment,
and furnished them with means of acquiring wealth.”</p>

<p class="p1">What seems to confirm this was the setting at liberty
by Doria of the renegade corsair Dragut, who had been
made prisoner, and who was a favourite of Barbarossa,
and a scourge to the Christians.</p>

<p>In 1547 a conspiracy of the Fieschi almost cost
Andrew Doria his life. His nephew was murdered by
them, but at the same time Giovanni Luigi Fieschi was
drowned. Grief and resentment provoked Andrew Doria
to commit acts of atrocious cruelty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely was this conspiracy crushed, before Giulio
Cibo, brother-in-law of Giovanni Luigi Fieschi, formed
another out of the remnant of the faction. This was
discovered; Cibo had his head struck off, and all the
rest of the Fieschi and those who held by them were
banished. The brother of Giovanni Luigi fell into
Doria’s hands, and was by his orders sewn up in a sack
and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Andrew had been much worried by a pilot asking him
for this and for that. Doria said, “If you speak again
to me more than three words, I will have you hung.”
“Pay or discharge,” said the pilot. Doria laughed,
gave him his pay, and retained his services.</p>

<p>Andrew Doria met with a great reverse at the hands
of that same Dragut whom he had released to please
Barbarossa. In 1552 Dragut came on him when he
was least awares, and put him to flight. Dragut pursued
him, sank two of his vessels, captured seven of
his fleet with seven hundred German soldiers, and their
captain, Nicolas Madrucci.</p>

<p>Andrew died in his splendid palace near Genoa in
1560, at the age of 93, without leaving issue by his wife
who was niece of Pope Innocent VIII.</p>

<p>Albenga, easily reached from Alassio, either by road
or rail, is a most interesting but unhealthy town. It
lies low where three rivers, uniting, empty into the sea,
and the plain is made up of deposits brought down by
them. Anciently the sea reached to its walls, and
only withdrew in the tenth century. Albenga was the
capital of the Ligurian Ingauni, and a great naval
station. Thence sailed a fleet of thirty-two ships which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
fought the Romans in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 20. It helped Hannibal with
ships and men, and when Magone, brother of Hannibal,
was wounded, he retired to Albenga to be cured.</p>

<p>Afterwards it became, but reluctantly, allied to Rome.
In the times of Probus, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 276-282, a native of
Albenga, named Proculus, a man of extraordinary
strength, set up to be emperor, but was speedily killed.
Constantine, a grandee of the Court of Honorius, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
395-423, fortified the town, and he it was who built the
Ponte Longo, a Roman bridge now sunk to the spring
of the arches, and deserted by the river, which has completely
altered its course.</p>

<p>Albenga has a most interesting cathedral of the twelfth
century that has been mutilated and altered internally
into a rococo temple. The west front was partly removed
in renaissance times and rebuilt, clumsily; but
externally, the east end with its apses tells of the true
antiquity of the church. Hard by is what is still more
venerable: a baptistery, half buried in the soil, of the
fifth (?) century. It is descended into by fourteen steps, so
greatly has the soil risen since it was built. The building
is octagonal, and had its windows filled with pierced
slabs of stone; of these fillings in only two remain, one
very rich, with carved interlaced work as well as with
perforations. Within is a large font for immersion, as
at Ventimiglia, and the vault is sustained by eight
granite columns, probably taken from a Pagan temple.
The altar is ancient, enriched with mosaic work representing
the Agnus Dei surrounded by twelve doves.</p>

<p>At the east end of the cathedral is the Piazza dei
Leoni, where are three rude stone lions, remains of a
monument raised in 1288, but taken from an earlier
Roman structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>That which strikes the visitor especially, coming from
France, are the towers of the nobles. “Its thirteen
mediæval towers,” says Hare, “remind the Italian
traveller of S. Gimignano, rising out of the plain like a
number of tall ninepins set close together.” I do not
think there are thirteen; certainly not that number of
lofty towers; but the earthquake of 1887 damaged, or
threw down, several.</p>

<p>The finest are the Torre Balestrino, the cathedral
tower, and the Torre del Comune. Five of the old gates
remain. The church of S. Maria in Fontibus, in Genoese
Gothic, striped black and white marble, takes its name
from a spring that rises under the altar, and was supposed
to possess miraculous powers for the healing of
lepers.</p>

<p>A beautiful drive from Albenga up the valley leads
to Garlenda, where are paintings by Domenichino, a
S. Maurus, a Martyrdom of S. Erasmus, by Poussin; and
a Nativity of Our Lady by Guercino. At the time of the
French Revolution, when the troops were pouring over
the frontier into Italy, the parishioners of Garlenda,
fearful of being robbed of these artistic treasures, removed
and hid them.</p>

<p>The road to Garlenda passes through orchards of
peaches and fields of narcissus.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The valley is radiantly beautiful in spring. Overhead are
tall peach trees with their luxuriance of pink blossom. Beneath
these the vines cling in Bacchanalian festoons, leaping from
tree to tree, and below all large melons, young corn, and bright
green flax, waving here and there into sheets of blue flower,
form the carpet of Nature. Sometimes gaily-painted towers
and ancient <i>palazzi</i>, with carved armorial gateways and arched
porticoes, break in upon the solitude of the valley.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hare.</span></p>

<span class="mid">SAVONA</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap08">SAVONA, with its port, its towers, its engirdling
mountains, and its wide-stretching orange and
lemon orchards, is a very charming town.</p>

<p>The port, with its picturesque tower, engages the eye
at once. The cathedral, built in 1604, is in the uninteresting
style of that period. It contains some good
pictures by Brea, 1495, and Aurelio Robertelli, 1449;
and the tomb of the parents of Pope Sixtus IV. who
was a native of Celle, near Savona. His father was a
poor boat or fisherman called della Rovere; but it was
the whim of Francesco della Rovere, when he became
Pope under the title of Sixtus IV., to be thought a
scion of the ancient house of the same name at Turin.
A false pedigree was forged, and he purchased the
complaisance of the Turin family, and silenced their jibes,
by giving them two cardinal’s hats. He assumed their
arms&mdash;a golden oak tree on an azure ground&mdash;which
figures on the tomb at Savona, and which Michael
Angelo painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, in
compliment to Pope Sixtus and to his nephew Julius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis de la Rovere was born in 1414, and entered
the Franciscan order, became provincial of Liguria, and
finally general of the order. He was elevated to be
Cardinal by the advice of Bessarion, who had conceived
a high notion of his learning and abilities. He became
Pope in 1471 and occupied the papal chair till 1484, and
was perhaps the second wickedest pontiff seated on that
throne, coming only a short way after Alexander VI.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He began his career with a lie,” says Mr. Addington
Symonds, “for though he succeeded to the avaricious Paul,
who had spent his time in amassing money which he did not
use, he declared that he had only found 5,000 florins in
the Papal treasury. This assertion was proved false by the
prodigality with which he lavished wealth immediately upon
his nephews. It is difficult even to hint at the horrible
suspicions which were cast upon the birth of two of the
Pope’s nephews. Yet the private life of Sixtus rendered the
most monstrous stories plausible. We may, however, dwell
on the principal features of his nepotism; for Sixtus was the
first pontiff who deliberately organised a system for pillaging
the Church in order to exalt his own family to principalities.
The names of the Pope’s nephews were Leonardo, Giuliano,
and Giovanni della Rovere, the three sons of his brother
Raffiello; Pietro and Girolamo Riario, the two sons of his
sister Jolanda; and Girolamo, the son of another sister,
married to Giovanno Basso. With the notable exception of
Giuliano della Rovere, these young men had no claim to
distinction beyond good looks and a certain martial spirit
which ill suited with the ecclesiastical dignities thrust upon
some of them. Leonardo was made Prefect of Rome and
married to a natural daughter of King Ferdinand of Naples.
Giuliano received a cardinal’s hat, and after a tempestuous
warfare with the intervening Popes, ascended the holy chair
as Julius II. Girolamo Basso was created Cardinal of San
Cristogono.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But the favourite nephew of all was Pedro Riario,
whom his uncle loaded with ecclesiastical benefices,
though aged only five-and-twenty. Scandal asserted,
and Muratori believed it, that this Pietro was really the
son of the Pope. When scarce out of the hobbledehoy
age, he was made Cardinal Patriarch of Constantinople
and Archbishop of Florence. His annual income was
60,000 gold florins, in our money about £100,000; and
yet when he died, broken down by his debaucheries, in
1474, three years after he had been made Cardinal
Archbishop, he was deep in debt.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He had no virtues, no abilities, nothing but his beauty,
the scandalous affection of the Pope, and the extravagant
profligacy of his own life, to recommend him to the notice of
posterity. All Italy during two years rang with the noise of
his debaucheries. When Leonora of Aragon passed through
Rome, on her way to wed the Marquess of Ferrara, this fop
of a Patriarch erected a pavilion in the Piazza di’ Sante
Apostole for her entertainment. The air of the banquet hall
was cooled with pure water; on a column in the centre stood
a naked gilded boy, who poured forth water from an urn. The
servants were arrayed in silk, and the seneschal changed his
dress of richest stuffs and jewels four times in the course of
the banquet. Nymphs and centaurs, singers and buffoons,
drank choice wines from golden goblets.... Happily for the
Church and for Italy, he expired at Rome in January, 1474,
after parading his impudent debaucheries through Milan and
Venice, as the Pope’s Legate.”</p>

<p class="p1">Another nephew was Girolamo Riario, who married
a natural daughter of Galeazzo Sforza. For him the
Pope bought the town of Imola with Church money.
He had created him Count of Bosco in 1472. As Imola
did not content his ambition, his uncle gave him Forli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and elevated this boatboy to a dukedom. The young
ruffian found that the Medici family stood in the way
of extending his power over Florence, and he formed
a plot for their destruction. In the conspiracy were
involved Francis di Pazzi, head of the bank of that
name in Rome, and Salviati, a Florentine, Archbishop
of Pisa, whose elevation had been opposed by the
Medici. The plot was atrocious; it was no less than to
assassinate Giuliano and Lorenzo di Medici in the
duomo at Florence on Easter Day at high mass. It had
the hearty concurrence of him who held the keys of
heaven and hell. Into the wicked confederacy was
taken a Captain Montesecco, an intimate friend of
Girolamo Riario, the Pope’s nephew, and Bandini, a
hired murderer. It was arranged among them that
Montesecco was to poignard Giuliano, and Bandini
was to stab Lorenzo; and the signal for the deed was
to be the Elevation of the Host. On the Sunday appointed,
1478, the assassin Montesecco embraced the two
Medici as they entered the church and assured himself
by his touch that they were unprotected with coats of
chain-mail, such as they usually wore under their silken
habits. But at the last moment this captain, cut-throat
though he was, felt hesitation at committing the deed
in the sacred building and at such a solemn moment,
and communicated his scruples to Girolamo Riario;
and the latter had hastily to open his scheme to a
couple of priests and induce them to undertake the
murder. As a chronicler of the time says: “Another
man was found, who, being a priest, was more accustomed
to the place and therefore less scrupulous
about its sanctity.” The second priest was to take the
place of Bandini should he entertain qualms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>But this change of persons spoiled all. The priest,
though more irreligious, was less expert. Giuliano was
indeed stabbed to death by Bandini di Pazzi, at the
moment of the Elevation of the Host, but Lorenzo
escaped with a flesh wound from the inexperienced
hand of the priest, and fled into the sacristy. The
congregation, the whole populace of Florence, rose as
a man, and pursued the murderers. The Archbishop
Salviati di Pazzi, and some of the others, were seized
and hung from the windows of the Palazzo Pubblico, the
same day; and the eighteen-year-old Cardinal Raphael
Riario was flung into prison.</p>

<p>Sixtus was furious at the failure of the plot, and
demanded the liberation of his great nephew, the boy-Cardinal,
and at the same time the expulsion of the
Medici from Florence. As the citizens refused to do
this, he excommunicated Lorenzo di Medici, and all the
heads of the Republic, and placed Florence under an
interdict. After a few days the boy was released; but
that was as far as the Florentines would go. Accordingly
the Pope, his nephew Riario, and the King of Naples,
who had entered into league with the Pope, raised armies
to attack Florence, and a savage war of revenge raged
for years. It was not till 1481 that a descent of the
Turks on Otranto made Sixtus tremble for his own
safety, and forced him to make peace with Florence.</p>

<p>After the death of Pietro, Sixtus took his nephew,
Giovanni della Rovere, into the favour that Pietro had
enjoyed. He married him to Giovanna, daughter of the
Duke of Urbino, and created him Duke of Sinigaglia.
This fellow founded the second dynasty of the Dukes of
Urbino.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The plebeian violence of the Della Rovere temper,” says
Mr. Addington Symonds, “reached a climax in Giovanni’s son,
the Duke Francesco Maria, who murdered his sister’s lover
with his own hands, when a youth of sixteen, and stabbed
the Papal Legate to death in the streets of Bologna, when at
the age of twenty, and knocked Guicciardini, the historian,
down with a blow of his fist during a council of war in 1526.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Christendom beheld in Sixtus the spectacle of a Pope who
trafficked in the bodies of his subjects, and the holy things of
God, to squander basely-gotten gold upon abandoned minions.
The peace of Italy was destroyed by desolating wars in the
advancement of the same worthless favourites. Sixtus destroyed
to annex Ferrara to the dominions of Girolamo Riario.
Nothing stood in his way but the House of Este, firmly planted
for centuries and connected by marriage or alliance with the
chief families of Italy. The Pope, whose lust for blood and
broils were equalled only by his avarice and his libertinism,
rushed with wild delight into a project which involved the
discord of the whole peninsula. He made treaties with
Venice and unmade them, stirred up all the passions of the
despots and set them together by the ears, called the Swiss
mercenaries into Lombardy, and when, finally, tired of fighting
for his nephew, the Italian powers concluded the peace of
Bagnolo, he died of rage in 1484. The Pope did actually die
of disappointed fury, because peace had been restored to the
country he had mangled for the sake of a favourite nephew.”</p>

<p class="p1">This Pope seemed unable to exist without some cringing
favourite about his person. In 1463 he made his
valet, a lad of no character and parts, of base birth, with
nothing but his good looks and obsequiousness to speak
for him&mdash;Cardinal and Bishop of Parma, when his age
was only twenty.</p>

<p>Sixtus was always impecunious. To replenish his
treasury he had two resources. One was the public sale
of places about the Court, and of benefices and of
ecclesiastical privileges. “Our churches, priests, altars,
sacred rites, our prayers, even heaven and our God, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
all purchasable,” is the exclamation of Baptista Mantuanus,
a scholar of the period. His second expedient
was the monopoly of corn throughout the Papal States.
Fictitious dearths were created; the value of wheat was
raised to famine prices, and good grain was sold out of
the States of the Church and bad grain was imported,
that the Pope might pocket the profits of the transaction.
Sixtus forced his subjects to buy at his stores, and
regarded their sufferings, and the disease bred of famine,
with indifferent eye.</p>

<p>But, bad as he was, Sixtus did some good things. He
laid the basis of the great Vatican library, built a bridge
over the Tiber, and widened some of the streets.</p>

<p>To him is due the introduction into the calendar of
the Feasts of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin, also
of the Presentation in the Temple, and of Ste. Anne, all
three of which find their place in the Anglican calendar;
also of S. Joseph.</p>

<p>Sixtus happily put an end to the cruel persecution of
the “Spirituals,” a branch of the Franciscan Order
which advocated absolute poverty, and adherence to the
original mandates of the founder. Their prophet and
theologian had been d’Oliva. Pope John XXII. had
pronounced the writings of d’Oliva heretical, and had
handed over the “Spirituals” to the Inquisition, to be
dealt with as heretics. Between 1316 and 1352 as many
as 114 of them were burnt at the stake; but Sixtus IV.
reversed the judgment of John XXII. and declared
this teaching of Oliva to be orthodox; so that those who
had been burnt in accordance with the judgment of one
Pope, were martyrs for the truth according to the
decision of another.</p>

<p>Sixtus died in 1484.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephanus Infessura, a contemporary diarist, writes on
his death:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Sixtus died, on which most happy day God showed His
power on earth, in that He liberated His Christian people from
the hand of such an impious and iniquitous ruler, in whom was
no fear of God, no love for the rule of Christian people, no
charity, no tenderness, nothing but vile lusts, avarice, pride,
and vain glory.”</p>

<p class="p1">He goes on with a catalogue of his crimes too horrible
to be quoted.</p>

<p>So impressed was the College of Cardinals, on the
death of Sixtus IV., with the injury done to the Church
by the nepotism of the deceased Pope, by his alienation
of Church fiefs to his kinsmen and favourites, that on the
election of his successor, Innocent VIII., they made him
swear on every relic and by everything that is held most
sacred in Christendom, that he would not continue the
same abuses. He took the required oath, and no sooner
was he enthroned than he absolved himself from the
oaths he had taken.</p>

<p>The same farce was enacted with Julius II. in 1503.
It really seemed like a Nemesis, that the Popes, who,
since the time of Gregory VII., had shown a rare
ingenuity in inventing oaths by means of which to
entangle men’s consciences and bring everything under
their power, now themselves took oaths, which they as
regularly broke. Indeed, it became obvious that no
solemn oath taken by a Pope was worth the breath that
uttered it, as he could at once absolve himself from
observing it; and it is a riddle how the cardinals should
have persisted in exacting capitulations from the Popes,
when they must have known that they would break
their plighted word as soon as ever they assumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
tiara. Julius II. pushed on the fortunes of his family,
which had been already aggrandised by Sixtus IV.
This done, he could devote himself, undisturbed by the
importunities of his kindred, to the gratification of that
innate love for war and broil which was the ruling
passion of his life.</p>

<p>He was the fighting Pope, stern, resolute, indomitable.
The whippings he had received from his father had
steeled his spirit instead of breaking it. His portrait
by Raphael admirably expresses the character of this
second Della Rovere Pope. The hard, cold eye, the set
frown, the determined mouth, about which a smile never
quivered, and the flowing white beard, are eminently
characteristic of the man. There is not in the face a
trace of the ecclesiastic, not an indication of his having
led a spiritual life. But for the habit, he might have
been a doge or a military leader.</p>

<p>Ranke thus describes him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Old as Julius was, worn by the vicissitudes of good and
evil fortune experienced through a long life, by the fatigues of
war and exile, and, above all, by the consequences of intemperance
and profligacy, he yet did not know what fear or
irresolution meant. In the extremity of age, he still retained
that great characteristic of manhood, an indomitable spirit.
He felt little respect for princes, and believed himself capable
of mastering them all. He took the field in person, and
having stormed Mirandola, he pressed into the city across the
frozen ditches and through the breach; the most disastrous
reverses could not shake his purpose, but seemed rather to
waken new resources in him. He was accordingly successful;
not only were his own baronies rescued from the Venetians,
but in the fierce contest that ensued he finally made himself
master of Parma, Placentia, and even Reggio, thus laying the
foundation of a power such as no Pope ever possessed before
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>A shrewd, dissolute, wicked man, he was superior to
Sixtus in ability.</p>

<p>He had his mistresses, his luxury, his simony, and his
cruelty, as Macchiavelli wrote of him.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Savona has no
cause to glory in those whom she sent to occupy the
chair of S. Peter.</p>

<p>But the place is associated with another Pope, and
that one of a different stamp altogether, the unfortunate
Pius VII., relegated there in 1809, and obliged to remain
there till 1814. Pius was a good, quiet man, without
force of character. When Napoleon let him understand
that the States of the Church were to be taken from
him, Pius was in dire distress and perplexity. Acting
on the advice of his confidential attendant, Cardinal
Pacca, he launched an excommunication at Bonaparte,
Miollis, governor of Rome, all the French, and all such
Romans as participated in the annexation of the States
to the kingdom. The document was nailed up to the
doors of several of the Churches of Rome,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But nobody seemed a penny the worse.”</p>

<p class="pn1">till an event occurred which startled the good people of
the Eternal City.</p>

<p>There was a grand reception at the Chigi Palace, to
which persons of all shades of politics were invited. A
large company had already assembled, when the major-domo
announced, “The Princess Borghese!” Now
Prince Borghese had been an active partisan of Bonaparte
and of the New Order. It was felt that the Prince
and the Princess were both involved in the sentence of
excommunication, and in former days no one would
have dared to receive into his house those who had
fallen under the ban of the Church. Presently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
guests sat down to cards, and all went merrily until
one o’clock struck, when the Princess fell back in her
chair, and though she tried to speak, no intelligible
sound issued from her lips. Helpless and speechless,
she was conveyed to her own house, where she died
three days later.</p>

<p>Then, as may be imagined, tongues wagged. It was
confidently asserted that the Princess had been struck
down by Providence. Her sudden death was represented
as a just punishment for her sin in espousing
the cause of the Pope’s enemies; and fanatics held her
up as an awful example and a warning.</p>

<p>It was useless to hint that Providence had struck
at very poor game&mdash;an already half-paralysed old
woman&mdash;instead of smiting the real offenders. The
Princess was in indifferent health at the time, had lost
the use of her right arm through one stroke, and the
recurrence was what might have been anticipated. No
one would hear a word. She had reaped what others
had sown.</p>

<p>Count Miollis now resolved on removing the Pope
from the city. Although his excommunications and
interdicts might safely be laughed at, yet his presence
in Rome was a hindrance to general reform of abuses,
and his person was a centre for every sort of cabal.
The Pope was in the Quirinale, which was close barred.
In the evening of June 5th the palace was surrounded
by French soldiers, and pickets of cavalry patrolled
the adjacent streets. Miollis authorised General Radet
to use force if necessary, to enter the Quirinale and
get possession of the Pope. Count Miollis stationed
himself in a summer-house in the Colonna gardens,
whence he could issue directions. Large numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the Italian and Roman nobles and people of the middle-class
assembled to see what would take place.</p>

<p>The clock at the Quirinale was striking three-quarters
after two when Miollis made a sign to commence
operations. The gates remained fast shut. The French
soldiers tried to scale the garden walls, but failed; and
men were sent in hot haste to borrow ladders for the
purpose. These were obtained; but the first who surmounted
the wall, lost his footing in attempting to
descend on the farther side, and broke his leg. Another
judgment! and again levelled at very poor game. He
was a mulatto. General Radet, with a small following,
made good his entrance into the palace through a
window, and reached the grand staircase, which was
crowded with papal servants, who offered but a feeble and
half-hearted resistance, and were at once overpowered.</p>

<p>In the meantime the other party had effected an
entrance over the garden wall.</p>

<p>Radet lost no time in gaining the Pope’s apartments.
One or two doors had to be broken open, and then he
reached the ante-chamber, where were drawn up the
Papal Swiss guards. They at once laid down their
arms, without a show of fight. When a couple more
doors had been forced Radet reached the Pope’s audience
chamber. Pius had rigged himself up so as to produce
an impression. He wore a white silk cassock, a <i>mozetta</i>
on his head of crimson silk, and a gold stole. He was
seated at a table with Cardinals Pacca and Despuig.
But Radet was not overawed, as were the Gauls by the
sight of the white-bearded senators. Advancing, he
said, with courtesy,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have a most painful and trying commission to
execute, but I have sworn fidelity and obedience to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Emperor, and I must obey his orders. On the part,
therefore, of his Majesty, I have to intimate to your
Holiness that you must renounce all temporal sovereignty
over Rome and the Roman States.”</p>

<p>The Pope replied calmly: “I believed that I had
complied with the Emperor’s orders, when I took the
oath of fealty and obedience to him. We cannot cede
or renounce what is not our own. The temporal power
belongs to the Roman Church, and we are only the
administrators. Must we go alone?”</p>

<p>“No; your Holiness can take Cardinal Pacca with
you.”</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards the Pope, wearing
his red hat and mantle, left the Quirinale, and, along
with Cardinal Pacca, entered a carriage. General Radet
and an officer took seats opposite, and the blinds were
drawn down on the side on which sat the Pope.</p>

<p>When the carriage was on its way Pius suddenly
exclaimed: “I have forgotten to bring my money; all
I have in my pocket is twenty bajocchi.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the Cardinal, “have only five.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Pope, “this may be regarded as a
truly apostolic journey, with one franc seventy-five
centimes between us.”</p>

<p>The Pope was conveyed somewhat hastily to Savona,
where he was well received, but kept under surveillance
for nearly six years.</p>

<p>Savona was made the capital of the department of
Montenotte by Napoleon. The see was founded in 680.
From 1499 to 1528 it was entirely in the hands of the
Della Rovere and Riario families for five successions.
In 1098 it was the see of the bishop Peter Grossulano,
whose story is strange enough. Anselm, Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of Milan, died at Constantinople on his return from a
crusade early in October, 1100. During his absence
Grossulano had been constituted by him administrator
of the archdiocese, of which Savona was a suffragan.
When Grossulano heard of the death of Anselm, he
proceeded to an election of a successor, and was himself
chosen by the majority of the clergy and people. He
at once mounted the archiepiscopal throne.</p>

<p>Milan had not long before passed through the furious
and savage troubles of Ariald and Herlembald over
the marriage of the clergy. There still remained in
Milan the turbulent Liprand, dissatisfied that peace had
settled down on the place. Possibly Grossulano was
not sufficiently rigorous against married clergy, perhaps
he had in some unknown way offended Liprand’s vanity,
for the latter at once ranged himself in opposition and
sent to the Pope to entreat him to withhold the pall
from the newly elected bishop. But Paschal would not
listen to his remonstrances, and, acting on the advice
of S. Bernard, abbot of Valumbrosa, he confirmed the
election and sent the pall.</p>

<p>Angry at this, Liprand did his utmost to rouse the
people against their archbishop, and became such a
nuisance that Grossulano summoned a provincial council,
and, addressing the people, said: “If any one has aught
against me, let him proclaim it openly, otherwise he
shall not be heard.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Liprand gathered a crowd of the disaffected
in his church of S. Paul, and in it denounced
the archbishop as simonacal, and he appealed to the
judgment of God against him. He would have a fire
lighted and pass through it to establish his assertion.
But the bishops assembled in council forbade the ordeal.</p>

<p>However, as he continued to be a source of evil in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Milan, Grossulano told him that he must either pass
through the flames or quit Milan. Liprand chose the
first alternative, but arranged the matter so that there
were two fires made at a convenient distance apart, and
he marched between them unhurt. Two years later
Liprand was summoned to Rome and sharply reprimanded;
nevertheless, Milan continued to be torn by
factions, Liprand and his followers refusing to receive
the ministrations of Grossulano and his clergy.</p>

<p>At last the Archbishop departed for Jerusalem.
During his absence Liprand became more abusive and
uproarious, and managed to gather together a sufficient
party to elect in the room of Grossulano an ignorant,
uneducated man called Giordano, to be archbishop; and
the three suffragans of Asti, Genoa, and Turin consecrated
him. The bishop of Turin hurried to Rome
to obtain the pall for Giordano. Paschal was in the
midst of his strife with Henry V., and it was essential
that he should have the support of the Archbishop of
Milan. He could not be certain of Grossulano, whether
he were anti-imperial or not; besides, he was absent.
Giordano he hoped to use as a tool. Accordingly he
sent the pall to him, but stipulated that he was not to be
arrayed in it till he had sworn absolute submission to
the Pope, and to refuse investiture from the Emperor.</p>

<p>For six months Giordano steadfastly refused to receive
the pall on these terms, but his scruples vanished
on the return of Grossulano, and he submitted unreservedly
to the Pope, who summoned a council in
the Lateran Palace, 1116, when a mock hearing of the
case took place; Grossulano was dismissed to Savona,
and Giordano was confirmed in his usurpation.</p>

<p>Savona was a margravate held by a junior branch of
the great house of Monferrat. The Emperor Otto I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
raised Aleram, Count of Monferrat, to the dignity of
margrave. Boniface, descended from a junior son, became
Margrave of Saluzzo. He died in 1130, and his
second son Enrico became Margrave of Savona. These
margravates were much like sea-anemones; when divided
up, each several parcel became an entire margravate
complete in itself. In 1215 Savona was gripped by
rapacious Genoa, and the last margravate died in 1233.</p>

<p>A pretty drive of an hour takes one up the valley to
Santuario, a pilgrimage church with hospice, founded in
1536. The church, which is rich in marbles, contains
a miraculous image of the Virgin, tricked out with
velvet and jewels. She wears a diamond collar given
by King Charles Albert, and a jewelled crown presented
by Pope Pius VII. The chapter of S. Peter’s
claims the right to decide what miraculous images are
to be honoured with crowns, but the crowns themselves
are conferred by the popes. In 1632 a certain Count
Alessandro Sforza, a fanatic from Piacenza, by his will
left rents of a large estate to furnish gold and jewels
for this purpose; as time went on, the property grew in
value, and the crowns at the same time became more
splendid. The honour is usually reserved for the Virgin,
but occasionally the Bambino is remembered as well.
Figures of Christ are, however, never deemed worthy
of being crowned, except He be represented as a babe.</p>

<p>The story of this image is not particularly novel and
interesting. It was found by a peasant where now
stands a little circular chapel on the hill above the
present sanctuary. He saw the Virgin in a vision, who
bade him go to Savona and bid the people erect a
church to enshrine her. He did as bidden, but the good
folk in Savona would not believe him, thought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
crazed, and locked him up. In the night the Virgin
released him. After some further trouble, and some
further miracles, the story was believed and the sanctuary
was erected.</p>

<p>Beside the image is a little marble figure representing
the countryman who started the cult. Beneath the
feet of the Virgin issues a spring of water that is
supposed to cure all diseases, but is so intensely cold
as to be more likely to do harm than good.</p>

<p>At Varazzi, near Savona, was born the famous
Jacques de Voragine, about the year 1230. Nothing is
known of the social position of his parents. In one of
his writings he speaks of the eclipse of 1239, and says
that he was still a child when it occurred. He became
a dominican in 1244, and in 1292 was elected to the
bishopric of Genoa. He laboured hard to effect a truce
between the Ghibelline and Guelf factions, which for
two whole months converted the streets of the capital
of Liguria into a field of battle. He succeeded. But the
peace was soon broken again. The story goes of him
that, being present in S. Peter’s along with Boniface VIII.
on Ash Wednesday, during the ceremonies, the pontiff,
supposing him to belong to the imperial party, dashed
the ashes in his face, shouting, “Remember, thou
Ghibelline, that thou and thy Ghibellines will be reduced
to dust.” Jacques is chiefly known through his <i>Legenda
Aurea</i>, a collection of the most outrageous, but also
the most romantic fables of the saints; a work that
had an enormous sale in the Middle Ages, and was
copied again and again, and read everywhere, and, incredible
as it may seem, was believed as gospel. He
died 1298.</p>

<p>At Albizzola Superiore is the palace of the Della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Rovere family. Giuliano, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV.,
as a boy was wont to carry the farm produce from his
father’s farm to Savona, either by boat or mule, however
rough the season might be, and, if he did not sell in the
market, was unmercifully thrashed by his father on his
return. But when his uncle became Pope, all this was
altered. He entered the ecclesiastical profession, became
a cardinal, and finally Pope, as already told. The palace
was built out of the plunder of the Church.</p>

<p>Mme. de Genlis visited the Della Rovere palace at
Albizzola. She says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The gardens are vast, but tasteless. I remarked there one
thing very singular&mdash;there were none of the charming flowers
one sees growing naturally in the fields; only oranges were there,
and box; this latter cultivated with the utmost care, in the
most superb vases that decorate the terraces. This villainous
box, planted in splendid vases, occupies its position solely
because it is more rare and costly a plant than myrtles, jessamines,
and oleanders.”</p>

<p class="p1">She has given us an account of her journey to
Albenga, over rocks, the mountain road being so steep
and so dangerous that descents had to be made on foot.
“I may almost say that we arrived barefooted, for the
stones during three days had so worn and pierced our
shoes, that the soles were nearly gone.” And beyond
Savona she says</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">“the journey is most dangerous, but at the same time
most interesting. The horror of the precipices made me
walk three-quarters of the way, over stones and cutting rocks.
I arrived at Genoa with my feet swollen and full of blisters,
but otherwise in rude health.”</p>

<p class="p1">How the journey from Marseilles to Genoa has
changed since Mme. de Genlis took that road with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Duchesse de Chartres a few years before the outbreak
of the Revolution, may be judged by some further
instances.</p>

<p>When the party left Antibes for Nice, they went by
sea, because of the badness of the road; and were
obliged to be accompanied by a felucca with a whole
regiment on board, to protect them against corsairs.</p>

<p>At Ospidaletta</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">“we were forced to halt and spend the night, one of the most
frightful places that hospitality ever provided. We slept three
in one room, and we made up a sort of bed for Mme. the
Duchess of Chartres with mule cloths and leaves. In one
room were two great heaps of corn, and the master of the house
assured us that we should sleep well if we buried ourselves in the
grain. The gentlemen gave us their cloaks to cover the corn.
One had to go to bed in the most extraordinary attitude&mdash;in
fact, almost upright. We passed the night in continual interruptions,
caused by slidings down and by the upset of masses
of corn. With joy we saw the day dawn; and as we had slept
in our clothes, our toilettes did not occupy us long.”</p>

<p class="p1">The whole of the Riviera from Nice to Genoa&mdash;indeed,
the whole of Provence&mdash;is studded with ruined castles
and palaces: of these, only the most mean, that house of
cards, Monaco, remains intact. They tell us of a time
when the great families lived in lordly state, under the
absolutism of the French crown or the despotism of the
Genoese Republic. In Genoa itself the families inscribed
on the Golden Book, and alone having the right
to sit in council and direct the affairs of state, and mismanage
and oppress the Ligurian coast and Corsica, did
not exceed one hundred and seventy. But in Liguria
there were at least four hundred and fifty noble families
decorated with titles, possessing vast estates, commanderies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and hereditary wealth, who were excluded
from all share in the government.</p>

<p>All have gone under, not in the wars for the Milanese,
but in the Revolution; and these ruined castles and
palaces are their tombstones. Who can doubt that
it is well that so it should have been. In the words of
Macaulay:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The volcano has spent its rage. The wide waste produced
by its outbreak is forgotten. The landmarks which were swept
away have been replaced. The ruined edifices have been
repaired. The lava has covered with a rich incrustation the
fields which it once devastated, and, after having turned a
beautiful and fruitful garden into a desert, has again turned the
desert into a still more beautiful and fruitful garden. The
marks of its ravages are still all around us. The ashes are
beneath our feet. In some directions the deluge of fire still
continues to spread. Yet experience surely entitles us to
believe that this explosion will fertilise the soil which it has
devastated. Already, in those parts which have suffered most
severely, rich cultivation and secure dwellings have begun to
appear amidst the waste.”</p>

<p class="p1">The palaces of the Lascaris, the Grimaldis, the
Durazzos, the Della Roveres, the Dorias, are in ruins,
but in their places rise hotels de Paris, de l’Univers, the
Metropole; and the bands of bravos entertained by the
nobles are replaced by Italian and Swiss waiters.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The more we read the history of past ages, the more we
observe the signs of our own times, the more do we feel our
hearts filled and swelled up by a good hope for the future
destinies of the human race.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
